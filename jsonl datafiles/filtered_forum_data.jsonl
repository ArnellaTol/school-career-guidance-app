{"text": "Question: Do optometrists have trouble finding job openings once graduated?\nThere are so many optometrist school graduates and limited job openings. #graduate #optometry\nAnswer: Employment of optometrists is projected to grow 27 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations.\n\n\nBecause vision problems tend to occur more frequently later in life, an aging population will require more optometrists. As people age, they become more susceptible to conditions that impair vision, such as cataracts and macular degeneration.\n\n\nThe number of people with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, has grown in recent years. Diabetes has been linked to increased rates of several eye conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, a condition that affects the blood vessels in the eye and may lead to loss of vision. More optometrists will be needed to monitor, treat, and refer individuals with chronic conditions stemming from diabetes.\n\n\nIn addition, nearly all health plans cover medical eye care and many cover preventive eye exams. Furthermore, the number of individuals, particularly children, who have access to vision or eye care insurance is expected to continue to increase because of federal health insurance reform. More optometrists will be needed to provide services to more patients.\n\n\nOptometrists Job Prospects\n\n\nBecause the number of optometrists is limited by the number of accredited optometry schools, licensed optometrists should expect good job prospects. Like admission to professional degree programs in other fields, admission to optometry programs is highly competitive.\n\n\nStudents who choose to complete a residency program gain additional experience that may improve their job prospects. Certification from the American Board of Optometry may also be viewed favorably by employers.\n\n\nIn addition, a large number of currently practicing optometrists are expected to retire over the coming decade, creating opportunities for new optometrists", "source": "forum_qa"}

Besides it is easy to outsource it to developing countries where production will cost substantially less. This is not the case for the drug development process, which will stay in the developed countries, where compliance with the strict regulatory requirements can be guaranteed. \n\n\nArtificial intelligence can speed up the process of drug discovery but this doesn't seem to happen for the moment.  On the opposite, the drug development process gets longer and longer, with more and more people involved in it. Before the Y2k it used to take some 6-8 years, but now it is close to 12-14 years and continues to increase. \n\n\nThe explosive development of the science brings more and more clinical trials of new molecules and regulations are constantly getting more stringent. This field has a high shortage of staff, more than 25%.

{"text": "Question: Would Video Game designer be considered as tech?\nSince their is a lot of programming put into creating video games would there be something in the tech department that could be beneficial to wanting to work in the gaming industry? Weather is has to do with animation or not. #tech #animation #gaming #game-design\nAnswer: The gaming industry is at full swing; video games are enjoyed by people of all ages, allowing players to step into an alternate world and become superhuman soldiers, expert tennis players, and world saviors.\n\n\nVideo games are extremely complex, in storyline alone, and there are millions of lines of code that develop every aspect of the game. From maps to characters, these games fulfill a reaction for every possible action that a player may choose. These worlds are courtesy of video game designers, who are responsible for the content and environment of every video game.\n\n\nWhat does a Video Game Designer do?\nA video game begins with a concept. A proposal is drafted by a team of game designers, who address important details such as target audience, requirements, deadlines, and budgets. Video game designers make that concept of gameplay and layout come alive, often through experimentation with several themes and genres, as well as developments and improvements on existing games.\n\n\nThis can include:\n\n\nPlots and storylines\nCharacters\nMaps, scenarios, and difficulties\nMethods for winning or losing the game\nUser interface creation\nAll of this is created through computer software in which the designer will input computer scripting, which is then processed by the software to generate commands, events, objects and characters that players interact with.\n\n\nThere are many types of game designers who focus on a particular aspect of gameplay. Most designers will spend at least some of their time as testers, where they can experiment with coding and watch others’ mistakes firsthand. Lead designers are the coordinators of the team and are responsible for communication inside and outside of the design team, as well as making important decisions. A game mechanics designer works on the balance of the game and its rule system. Lastly, an environmental designer is responsible for creating the different scenarios and environments of the game.\n\n\nA game will undergo millions of changes throughout its making, and game designers are required to constantly recheck and recode thousands of lines of code. A designer can also be called upon to develop a game to focus on a particular aspect, such as market, design, technology, or art.\n\n\nGames that are market-driven are designed to make a profit, and therefore their progress is limited to consumer demand. Most games are developed in this manner. Games that are design-driven allow the designer to take full reign of the game and its aspects. Many games are not developed in this manner because of monetary restraints. Games that are technology-driven are created in order to highlight a technological achievement or to market gaming consoles and engines, such as high-quality graphic displays. Rarely, a game will be art-driven, where a game is focused on visual effects and impressive designs created by artists.", "source": "forum_qa"}

Weather is has to do with animation or not. #tech #animation #gaming #game-design\nAnswer: A major in game design and development prepares students for immediate entry into the expanding interactive entertainment industry. If you love playing video games and think that you might like designing them yourself or being part of their creation, enrolling in a game design and development degree program could be just the right move.\n\n\nSeeing the creation of a video game through from start to finish can be a thrilling and rewarding experience. Degree programs in game design and development can give you first-hand experience doing just that. You can learn every facet of creating a challenging, visually stunning, and, most importantly, fun game.\n\n\nThere are as many kinds of video games as there are people. This means that game designers can often choose to work on the kinds of games they enjoy playing. Employers actually prefer it that way, as individuals with a lot of experience in a particular area of gaming may often have insightful ideas on how to improve game play. So, whether your forte is sports games, flight simulations, car racing games, arcade-style shoot-em ups, strategy games, or role-playing games, there is a game type to fit your particular style.\n\n\nA video game needs to have many different aspects working together in order to succeed. This means that there are many different ways to contribute to the creation of a video game. Video games need writers in order to create the story and dialogue, artists to render the characters and landscapes, programmers to translate everything into computer language and create fluid game play, and sound designers to create soundtracks, sound effects, and voices.", "source": "forum_qa"}

This can involve creating music, sound effects, or character voices in a video game.\n\n\nHow Much Money Does a Video Game Designer Make?\n\n\nThe video game industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, and most video game designers will usually make a decent amount of money. The median annual salary for a video game designer according the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is $58,510; $28.13/hr.\n\n\nVideo game designers truly do earn every penny of what they make, though.

Traditional colleges and universities will often offer several classes pertaining to video game design, for instance, but art or technology institutes may offer more specialized programs in this field.

Some art institutes may even offer video game design degree programs, which combine several artistic design classes with more technical computer courses. There are plenty of online options for those seeking more of a work from home experience.\n\n\nWhat Can a Person Do With a Degree In Video Game Design?\n\n\nSmall video game production companies are often looking for video game designers. Since these smaller companies often have limited budgets, however, they will generally not pay as much as larger companies. On the other hand, these smaller companies are usually a little more laid back than larger companies. A new graduate just starting his game design career typically has a better chance of securing employment with small or start-up companies.\n\n\nLarge multi-million dollar video game production companies are often a little harder to get into, and they are also a little more structured.

Know that you will struggle at times and it will be up to you to find the help you need, whether from professors, tutoring or classmates. Look into where you can find that help before you go.

{"text": "Question: How difficult is it to become a math teacher in NJ?\nChanges in testing, testing form an out of state college, getting a job, etc. #education #math\nAnswer: It is the goal of the New Jersey Department of Education to provide the state’s students with the best possible education in mathematics. This is important on several fronts; not least of which is the increasingly important role math plays in key industries like engineering and technology. Math teachers answer this call, providing a level of instruction that allowed New Jersey’s ACT test takers to earn the third-highest average math score in the country in 2016.\n\n\nStep 1. Complete a Math Teaching Degree\nThere are actually two components of a math teacher degree in New Jersey: a traditional math program and an education program that focuses on teaching. To complete this first component you will need to obtain at least 30 credits in the field of mathematics. The level of these courses needs to increase sequentially and include advanced courses in areas like:\n\n\nAlgebra\nCalculus\nGeometry\nStatistics\nFORTRAN programming language (Formula Translating System)\nPossible degrees that can fulfill these initial math course requirements include:\n\n\nB.S. or B.A. in Mathematics\nB.S. In Mechanical Engineering\nB.S. In Electrical Engineering\nThe other segment of your degree needs to include a teacher preparation program. This will prepare you to be an effective math teacher in the classroom, and traditionally culminates in a student teaching program. Courses in this segment include:\n\n\nFundamentals of education and pedagogy\nTeaching students with disabilities and special needs\nTeaching diverse students\nEducation psychology\nLesson planning\nStudent assessments\nSelf-evaluation and improvement\nStudent teaching\nWhile you are completing your degree you must maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 if you are graduating on or after September 2016. If you are graduating before this time, you are allowed to have a minimum GPA of 2.75. In some circumstances you can offset a lower GPA with a high test score detailed in Step 2.\n\n\nCandidates Who Already Have a Bachelor’s Degree\n\n\nIf you already have at least a bachelor’s degree in the field of mathematics you may be eligible for an alternative teaching preparation program. To date, more than 29,000 teachers have taken this route to certification in New Jersey.\n\n\nThis will allow you to begin teaching in the classroom after completing an initial intensive pedagogical segment, pairing you with an experienced math teacher mentor. This on-the-job training takes the place of student teaching. However, you will still be required to demonstrate you are ready to be placed in a classroom. You can do this by obtaining 24 hours of classroom teaching experience, and demonstrating such by submitting a verification form with your initial application for certification.\n\n\nOut-of-State Candidates\n\n\nIn general you will meet the math teacher certification requirements in New Jersey if you completed a program in your home state with requirements that are equivalent to New Jersey’s. If you have less than three years of teaching experience you will also need to meet New Jersey’s GPA requirements of 3.0 on or after September 2016, or 2.75 before. If you are a certified teacher in another state with at least one year of teaching experience you can apply directly for a Standard Teaching Certificate in New Jersey.\n\n\nStep 2. Complete the New Jersey Teacher Certification Testing Requirements\nThere are several tests you must pass in order to meet the requirements for math teacher jobs in New Jersey:\n\n\nBasic Skills Test\nPraxis II Math Exam\nPhysiology and Hygiene Test\nBasic Skills Test\n\n\nThis test will be required for all math teachers applying for certification starting in September 2015. The specific test you will need to take must be approved by the Commissioner of Education. The details of the exam are featured on the Educational Testing Services (ETS) website that details New Jersey requirements for testing. The Basic Skills Test is designed to ensure that you can meet the basic writing, reading, and problem solving skills needed by all teachers throughout New Jersey.\n\n\nYou may also be able to demonstrate you possess these basic required skills and thereby be exempt from this exam if you have proof of any of the following:\n\n\nScore of 1660 on the combined critical reading, writing, and mathematics portions of the SAT\nScore of 23 on the ACT\nGRE score of 4.0 on the analytical writing section plus a combined quantitative and verbal score of 310\nPraxis II Math Exam\n\n\nProspective math teachers for secondary school students will also need to pass the ETS Praxis II Mathematics: Content Knowledge exam. ETS offers a study guide for this test, for which you will have 150 minutes to complete 60 questions on the topics of:\n\n\nDiscrete mathematics\nAlgebra and functions\nNumber and quantity\nProbability and statistics\nGeometry\nFunctions\nETS will send your test score results from both its exams directly to the Department of Education. New Jersey offers a unique system of evaluation for your ETS testing scores. A high GPA from your academic program can offset a low ETS test score, and vice versa allowing for added flexibility.\n\n\nPhysiology and Hygiene Test\n\n\nThis test is administered at your local county’s Office of Education and is required to ensure you have a basic knowledge of health. You will be evaluated on the following, and you can gain an exemption from this test if you have completed basic military training or have completed college-level study in health, nutrition, or biology:\n\n\nEffects of narcotics and alcohol\nProper hygiene habits\nPhysiology, health, fitness and nutrition\n\n\nStep 3. Apply for New Jersey Math Teaching Certification\nOnce you have successfully completed an approved teacher preparation program along with your math degree, and have completed the required tests, you are eligible for what is known a Certificate of Eligibility with Advanced Standing. This will allow you to start working as a math teacher and get you one step closer to being eligible to step up to the next level in certification, a Standard Certificate.\n\n\nIf you have completed these accomplishments along with an alternative teacher preparation program, you are eligible for a Certificate of Eligibility that will also allow you to teach in New Jersey.\n\n\nYou can apply online for you New Jersey teaching certificate, however there are certain documents you will need to mail in to the Department of Education:\n\n\nVerification that you have completed a teaching preparation program\nAn official letter from the school where you completed your student teaching or on-the-job training, stating such\nOfficial college transcripts\nOath of allegiance (non-citizen oath of allegiance)\nResults of your Physiology and Hygiene test\nFee of $190 paid online\nOnce you have become a licensed teacher you can find vacant math teacher positions through websites like NJ School Jobs.\n\n\nStep 4. Obtain a Standard Teaching Certificate\nAfter you have found employment as a math teacher your next step will be to work towards a permanent Standard Teaching Certificate. This is done by completing what is known as a Provisional Teacher Program (PTP). This program is designed to act as a means of support for you while you become accustomed to your new career as a math teacher.\n\n\nOnce you are hired your district will enroll you in a local PTP. At this point you will be issued a Provisional Teaching Certificate that is valid for two years. Entrance to a PTP effectively converts your Certificate of Eligibility or Certificate of Eligibility with Advanced Standing to a Provisional Teaching Certificate. The PTP is a training program that you complete during your first year of employment.\n\n\nAs part of your PTP program you will need to attend at least 200 hours of formal instruction. This can be:\n\n\nAt approved regional training centers\nAt New Jersey colleges and universities\nThrough programs for those pursuing an alternate route to certification\nThrough a Master of Arts in Teaching program\nOnce you have completed your PTP program you will be eligible for recommendation by your home school district for a Standard Teaching Certificate.\n\n\nWhen completing your PTP, it is worth thinking about the option of earning a master’s degree such as an M.A.T., M.Ed. or MATL. This can be beneficial for several reasons:\n\n\nImproved job security based on a review of your qualifications\nAdded job flexibility to pursue advanced positions that require a master’s degree\nExperience and qualifications can be taken into consideration for salary increases", "source": "forum_qa"}

If you should get poor grades or take classes that they feel are not challenging, they could rescind their offer.

{"text": "Question: Why are education programs so different from state to state?\nLooking to go into the education field. #college #education #education-management\nAnswer: The education field, like many other fields that require special licensing, is allowed to vary from state to state by the federal government.  There are some minimum requirements that the federal Department of Education requires each state to meet.  There may also be different credentials within a state depending on the subject you want to teach and the grade level.  In California, to teach elementary school you need to have a multiple subject credential.  In order to teach middle and high school, you need to have a single subject credential in a specific subject like English or Math.  There are also credentials for teaching Special Education.  If you want to go into Early Childhood Education, that is a completely different set of requirements to meet.  You will need to figure out what age, grade, and subject you want to teach.  Then you can research your state's credential requirements (or another state's).  Most 4-year universities have teacher education programs; you can even start at a community college that has a teacher pathway program that will prepare you to transfer into a teacher education program at a 4-year university.", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: is the teaching profession good?\nwant to become a teacher, this profession is good for the future #teacher #professional #lecture\nAnswer: Hanging out with children all day keeps you young and ensures that your vocabulary, fashion and music tastes remain current and relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou make a massive difference in the lives of young people – even when you don’t even realise it. You might not know how many kids have taken your words of wisdom to heart and will go on to repeat them to their own children or even their own classes – but it’s more than you think.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are constantly learning new skills. You came in this job to teach maths, science or English. You now also run clubs, referee sports days, break up fights, do counselling and have learned an impressive array of arts and crafts for those pesky off-timetable days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo day is ever the same. Ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou build positive relationships with students, colleagues, parents and the wider community. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou become a role model. People look to you for advice and guidance and that feels pretty good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe children teach you as much as you teach them. Every teacher has had that moment where an innocent comment from a pupil has seriously hit home and changed their perspective. Also, you now know all the members of One Direction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is constant laughter. Learning can – and is – fun and that goes for the teacher too. These groups of kids you have grown fond of truly have bants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat moment where a student finally gets it. You’d been hitting a brick wall with this lesson but suddenly that look of realisation dawns on their face and you know you’ve cracked something. You’ve earned that rushed lunchtime sandwich crammed down your throat in between playground duty and chess club. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thank yous mean a lot. The end of year gifts are great (wine, please) – but the cards and verbal gratitude from the young people who you have impacted are just perfect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parents are pretty sound too. For every one that gives you a hard time and complains about the quantity of training days, there are ten that worship the ground you walk on for going the extra mile for their child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou get to meet colleagues with a passion for teaching equal to yours who will become friends for life – and the staple of your Friday night drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting to see students ‘make it’ after they leave is a sensational feeling. Knowing that you played a small part in someone achieving or even surpassing their dreams is the ultimate in job satisfaction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe challenge – and success – of getting the kid that hates you to like you. WIN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sheer chaos of a classroom. Noise, mess, laughter, excitement and pandemonium. What isn’t there to love?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatching friendships blossom between children always warms your heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeing excitement in children thrilled by a topic makes your day worthwhile. If you can blow a mind now and again, you will constantly be a source of interest. In fact, you are the life and soul of the party in the classroom. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeing a class of faces hanging onto your every word makes your chest swell with pride. Granted, it isn’t always that way (especially when you’re trying to teach fractions) but when you do get that captive audience, you know it’s going to be a lesson you’ll fondly remember.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen kids laugh at your jokes – especially the older kids. Making a teenager laugh with you and not at you is NOT EASY. So you live for the moments when you are the king or queen or banter. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen your harsher methods pay off. You don’t like giving discipline and you don’t like chucking in extra homework or scrawling red all over coursework – but the kids will eventually understand why you were a bit of an ogre and they will thank you. Which makes it all pay off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching becomes your life – it is not merely a job with nice ‘holidays’ – and you wouldn’t change it for the world.", "source": "forum_qa"}

Despite if the job is related to your specific degree or not, never think that a degree is a waste. The experiences that you gain in college will help you in all professions and the work force in general. It is the dedication and commitment that comes with going to school that shows an employer that you are the type of person that finishes something that you started. This is a valuable asset to any company to know that you are able to deliver and execute. Regarding the specific title of your degree and it not going to waste, find something that you love to do and educate yourself in that area. The job titles that are out there may not outline your degree exactly, but the skills that you obtained while getting that degree may help you in areas that you have not even thought of yet. Be willing to think outside the box and don't think about your degree as a whole, but the individual skills that you have learned and practiced while getting that degree. This will open your doors wide open to the potential career paths that are out there and will ensure that your degree does not go to \"waste\".

It is the gold standard in accounting and is worth the time spent studying for the exam.

Strategic planning and data analysis are a future-focus of HR and would be a great edge entering the field or taking skills to the next level.", "source": "forum_qa"}
{"text": "Question: What do you do in Human Resources?\nWhat are the responsibilities of someone working in HR and what can you expect your day to look like? #business #human-resources #hr #hr-consulting\nAnswer: Human resources is a somewhat vague term that doesn't capture well the scope of the duties in the department. While human resources staff handles many of the matters pertaining to the employees of a company, such as recruiting and benefits management, they also work with management to help develop long-term strategies for the growth and development of a company. HR departments often act as a middleman between employees and management and should be where employees go for basic company information.\n\n\nHiring\n\n\nThe first point of contact a prospective employee has with a company is generally through the HR department. Specific duties vary depending on the size of the company and department, but HR typically places advertisements for new employees and may attend job fairs and handle other recruiting duties. Staff will screen resumes, check references and perform any necessary background checks, and often conduct first interviews with applicants, coordinating follow-up interviews with other company departments and managers. HR performs orientations of new hires, informing them of policies, procedures, benefits and other relevant information.\n\n\nCompensation\n\n\nSome companies offer new employees letters of employment or employee contracts, which are drafted by HR staff. In some companies, particularly small businesses, HR will take on some payroll duties, such as tracking vacation time and pay, maintaining a holiday schedule, creating policies on flexible work hours and updating records when employees are promoted or transfer departments. Employee benefits, such as health insurance, retirement plans, transportation subsidies and other perks, are considered part of the overall compensation package and are administered by the HR department. In the big picture, HR monitors salary and wages within the company's industry to ensure compensation remains competitive. The department also helps management map out pay structures within the company.\n\n\nEmployee Relations and Performance\n\n\nIn addition to the initial training in company policies, the HR department often helps coordinate training and mentoring programs to further develop employee skills. Training programs may be developed in-house, depending on the resources within the company, or might be outsourced. HR staff may play a role in employee performance reviews, handle employee complaints, help resolve disputes and monitor employee remediation programs. For companies with union employees, HR often oversees union contracts and assists management with union negotiations. Many companies offer employee assistance programs that provide counseling and help for a variety of personal issues. While the programs are generally outsourced in small businesses, the HR department monitors compliance, contract and privacy issues with the organization handling the program.\n\n\nCompliance\n\n\nA number of compliance issues are important for a company to monitor, regardless of size. The HR department keeps track of federal and state laws regulating benefits and compensation, such as the Family Medical Leave Act and laws regarding overtime. The department also is tasked with ensuring a company complies with the federal regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, including auditing and reporting duties. It also typically handles disputes between employees, or any claims of sexual harassment or workers' compensation injuries.", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: What are some of the downsides of being a neurosurgeon?\n#doctor #medicalschool #neurology #chemistry #surgery #neurosurgeon\nAnswer: 1)Training Requirements:\nOne of the potential disadvantages of becoming a neurosurgeon is the training requirements involved. Before you can start working as a neurosurgeon, you must go through a number of years of intense training. You have to start out in a pre-med program and then get into medical school. Medical school usually takes another four years to complete. After medical school, you must go through a surgical residency to become a neurosurgeon. This takes several more years to complete. By the time you become a neurosurgeon, you have spent many years in school and made a large financial investment.\n2)Responsibility:\nAnother potential disadvantage of working as a neurosurgeon is the responsibility that comes with it. When you work as a neurosurgeon, you are dealing with people's spines and brains. One slight mistake could potentially cause major damage for your patient and could result in paralysis or death. This means that if you do not perform well every single day, you could end up hurting someone and their family significantly. This is one of the highest pressure jobs available in the medical field.\n3) Schedule:\nEven though most neurosurgeons strive to work on a particular schedule, this rarely can be adhered to. When you become a neurosurgeon, you are part of a very select group of surgeons. When someone needs surgery in this area, you can be called at any time day or night. This often results in the need to work many more hours than you would like to work. Working so many hours can put a strain on your personal life as well as your health.\n4) Continuing Education\nAnother potential disadvantage of working as a neurosurgeon is the need to engage in continuing education. Since you are counted on to provide excellent care in this area, you have to keep up with the latest technology and medical advances. This often requires you to take extra courses and training in the proper areas. You also must read many medical journals and other documentation to stay up-to-date on these advances. This can consume a lot of your time.", "source": "forum_qa"}

If you have a significant other (or friends and family) that have traditional 9-5 jobs, your hours are usually during the time they have off. This can put a big strain on relationships and can also make it difficult to celebrate special occasions with family members, attend weddings, etc. Also, depending on the type of kitchen you work in, the tasks can become very repetitive and monotonous. \n\nOwner: This is a whole other level of commitment. You are constantly the go-to person for any and all problems. If you can imagine the stress people associate with being a new mother (baby constantly crying, needing attention/feeding/changing/ etc) and the fact that you can't just take a break or walk away from it while it is \"new\", this can be a taxing job. Especially when you consider the pressure from being so financially connected with the business. Every problem becomes more personal and stressful because if the business fails, it has taken so much of your time and money. Of course, a business can level out and get established so you can have a day or two off.. but most restaurants (when they first open) don't make a profit for 6 months- 1 year (depending on how much the start up costs are and how long it takes to establish a client base), and for the first several months you will likely be there every day, and will be receiving calls and texts during times when you aren't there. \n\n\nThis takes a lot of work and love.

They examined teeth, took radiographs, and cleaned teeth.\nAs health care expenses have skyrocketed, there has been a movement to allow dental auxiliaries (including dental hygienenists, expanded-duty dental assistants, and so-called \"dental therapists\") to have a greater range of duties, either under various degrees of supervision by a licensed dentist, or in some cases independent of licensed dentists.\nUnderstandably this has caused quite an outcry among dentists.  But the continued lack of available and affordable dental care has prompted a move to allow a greater range of dental services to be provided by these so-called \"mid-level\" providers.\nThe rules governing the scope of dental hygiene practice vary from state to state.

{"text": "Question: Do most people who major in music finish college?\n#music #college #college-major  #music-industry\nAnswer: This is tricky to answer and varies by schools greatly.  Right now around 58.6% of all college majors graduate in the United States according to the National Center for Education Statistics.  Only 19% of those students complete their degrees in four years and there is a higher percentage of drop outs with minority ethnic backgrounds.  \nNow, with all of those facts listed out, they do not necessarily apply to you.  For instance, if you look at Berklee College of Music:\n\"Overall, 54.4% of Berklee College of Music Undergrads Finish Within Six Years\nAt Berklee College of Music, there were 1,100 bachelors degree candidates in the class of 2013. By 2015, six years after beginning their degree, 54.4% of these students had graduated. After an additional two years, 57.0% of this class eventually completed their degree.\" -College Factual (https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/berklee-college-of-music/academic-life/graduation-and-retention/, 2018). \nTo put this in perspective, Harvard has a 98% graduation rate (Harvard College, https://college.harvard.edu/what-harvards-graduation-rate, 2018).  The best advice is to talk to your potential schools about their graduation rates within the music program and understand that the graduation rate is completely dependent on you as a student.  This is just a number that represents how well the college is teaching students their material, funding their program, and getting students out into career placement.  Your individual experience will depend on how well you fit into that program, your college funding, and your expectations of college.  \nA better question to ask the college is how many individuals are employed in their field of study after graduation.

{"text": "Question: Sales representative\nWhat are some techniques which you should learn to become a good sales?  #sales\nAnswer: Learn how to connect with people. People buy from people they have things in common with and can connect on a personal level. Unless you can show genuine interest in the people you are selling to it can be a difficult thing to do. Through understanding who the person is you can relate the real benefits to them on what you are selling and provide the right solution to them. Know your product or products! You will lose the trust from your customer if they don't believe what you are talking about.  Overcome objections with clarifying what the objection is, don't just take no, understand why no so you can specifically overcome the real objection. Ask for the sale!

{"text": "Question: Why do positions in corporate America have such a negative connotation?\nPeople today tend to think \"corrupt\" when they think of people at the \"top of the totem pole\". There is often the dilemma of taking the high-paying corporate job vs. the low-paying job that is more in-line with ones values. #business #small-business #corporate\nAnswer: It's what you make it. Perception is reality. In any job or career anywhere you want it to be something you're passionate about and makes you want to get out of bed to fulfill. Like anywhere, in America, some people don't choose a job or career for the right reasons and don't muster the courage or motivation to pursue what they really love. Take chances in a field or organization if you think it's something you'll love but know you can always change your mind. Life is too short not to do something you love. It will bring happiness to other places in your life too, and who doesn't want that. 😉", "source": "forum_qa"}

If you know that the school is your first choice by far and you know without a doubt that you would go there, applying early decision is beneficial, as the acceptance rates for ED are generally higher than regular decision, so applying ED would give you a leg up on the competition. But if you're unsure about the school, ED is not the way to go, since it locks you in to attending if you are accepted. You can also only apply ED to one school.

{"text": "Question: Should students have to pay for #college?\nCollege should be #free for everyone.    If the world is focusing on a better society, # education should be free.\nAnswer: As it stands many colleges are already receiving tax-paid subsidies, resulting in lower tuition for students living in the area.  Colleges also receive grants for government research projects to assist in funding the universities.  Revenue also comes from sales from sporting events, contests, etc.  So even though it would be wonderful for college to be free, the funding to provide such would be extremely draining to our tax systems, and those who do not choose to go to college and receive higher education would be left holding the bill through their taxes.

{"text": "Question: what is the level of pressure when working as a physical therapist?\ncareer interest #physics #physical-therapist #physical\nAnswer: Background: Job stress has been associated with poor outcomes. In focus groups and small-sample surveys, physical therapists have reported high levels of job stress. Studies of job stress in physical therapy with larger samples are needed.\n\n\nObjective: The purposes of this study were: (1) to determine the levels of psychological job demands and job control reported by physical therapists in a national sample, (2) to compare those levels with national norms, and (3) to determine whether high demands, low control, or a combination of both (job strain) increases the risk for turnover or work-related pain.\n\n\nDesign: This was a prospective cohort study with a 1-year follow-up period.\n\n\nMethods: Participants were randomly selected members of the American Physical Therapy Association (n=882). Exposure assessments included the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), a commonly used instrument for evaluation of the psychosocial work environment. Outcomes included job turnover and work-related musculoskeletal disorders.\n\n\nResults: Compared with national averages, the physical therapists reported moderate job demands and high levels of job control. About 16% of the therapists reported changing jobs during follow-up. Risk factors for turnover included high job demands, low job control, job strain, female sex, and younger age. More than one half of the therapists reported work-related pain. Risk factors for work-related pain included low job control and job strain.\n\n\nLimitations: The JCQ measures only limited dimensions of the psychosocial work environment. All data were self-reported and subject to associated bias.\n\n\nConclusions: Physical therapists’ views of their work environments were positive, including moderate levels of demands and high levels of control. Those therapists with high levels of demands and low levels of control, however, were at increased risk for both turnover and work-related pain. Physical therapists should consider the psychosocial work environment, along with other factors, when choosing a job.", "source": "forum_qa"}
{"text": "Question: What is a GRE exam? Is it similar to the SATs?\nWhat does this exam actually measure?  #college #college-admissions #testing #prerequisites\nAnswer: It's the most commonly required admission test for grad school. Much like the SAT and ACT, the GRE exam is a broad assessment of your critical thinking, analytical writing, verbal reasoning, and quantitative reasoning skills — all skills developed over the course of many years.\n\n\nThe Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is a standardized test that is an admissions requirement for most Graduate Schools in the United States.[7] Created and administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) in 1949,[8] the exam aims to measure verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, analytical writing, and critical thinking skills that have been acquired over a long period of learning and that are not entirely based on any specific field of study outside of the GRE itself. The GRE General Test is offered as a computer-based exam administered at Prometric testing centers.\n\n\nIn the graduate school admissions process, the level of emphasis that is placed upon GRE scores varies widely between schools and between departments within schools. The importance of a GRE score can range from being a mere admission formality to an important selection factor.\n\n\nYou can learn more about it by checking the below mentioned link:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Record_Examinations", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: What does it take to succeed in engineering?\nKids in class are interested in learning more about this career.\nAnswer: Engineering is the practical application of technical knowledge to creatively solve a difficult problem.  As many people mention, you must have a strong technical knowledge base no matter what type of engineering field you choose.  That base is built on mathematical thinking, scientific curiosity, and breaking impossible challenges into small discrete solvable problems.  Being a good engineer is more about the personal traits and skills you develop.  Great engineers always believe they can do impossible things and never quit trying.  Sometimes it just takes longer than expected to develop the technology to solve the problems. \n\n\n1) Be curious about everything.  The more you know, the more likely you will find brilliance by applying ideas between different scientific fields.  Read, practice, and try everything you can related to math, science, and technology.  The internet is full of wonderful information like never before.  Use flipbook to access technical articles in specific fields every day.\n\n\n2) Build your skills early related to math, science, writing, communications, programming, and technical aptitude in what you enjoy (mechanical, chemical, electronics, etc.).  Take advantage of every after school program, summer program, and challenging course in school.  Make your own challenge projects at home to develop skills relevant to your technical interest areas.  Active practice is required to develop expertise and depth.\n\n\n3) Its possible to sit in isolation, but not likely in today's engineering world.  Your ability to communicate both written and in groups is essential to working in the engineering field.   Most technology is too advanced for a single person to solve all issues and take a new product to market.  Sharing ideas and working together is essential to success.\n\n\n4)  Determine which engineering discipline motivates you the most, and plan your college career with the best universities in mind.  They will be looking at how well rounded you are beyond just grades.  That college education will launch you into the field with opportunities at the best companies.  Experts in those companies will help you continue to learn and grow.  College is just an important starting point, and most of what you learn happens after college as your specialization deepens.\n\n\n5) Expect to work harder than most other fields.  You will have more difficult courses in college.  Your work life will have more time in the office solving challenges.  Engineering has its rewards, and you must expect to work very hard to succeed.", "source": "forum_qa"}

Any important set of skills, experiences, courses ...?\n#career #engineering #success #career-path #STEM\nAnswer: Join study groups with like-minded people.  Attend classes regularly and get into the habit of taking detailed notes during classes when the professors speak. Note taking is a good skill that can come handy at any point in life, be it your academic stint or your professional career. Work on all your assignments by yourself and only consult other students/TAs/professor only after you have given your best effort.  Make Google and YouTube your best friends; understanding the concept is very important; also developing the ability to explain the concept confidently and in layman's language to another person is even more important.  Be part of organizations or committees that are relevant for your STEM field. For example, if your major is Mechanical Engineering, you should be part of the Mechanical Engineers Association, Sales Engineering Club, etc.  Be dedicated to these clubs and try to get into leadership roles in these committees.  Networking is very important; try to network with as many people as possible, even though they are from a different major, try to get a broad overview of what their major is like.  Work on improving your soft skills: presentation skills, communication skills, etc.  Talking is important, but listening is even more important. Listen first, talk next.\nThen, focus on getting into a good summer internship program and work diligently throughout your internship by learning and networking as much as possible.

{"text": "Question: Do you think cleanliness is associated with your business success?\nsuper random question. It just seems like bosses try really hard to be clean in their workspaces and environments\nAnswer: It's not so much about being clean, as about being organised and efficient.  If your desk is covered in piles of paper and dirty coffee cups, it will take you far longer to find that vital piece of paper that you need, which reduces the amount of time you could be doing something useful.  Similarly, if you're concentrating on something, having a bunch of dirty coffee cups in your line of sight is distracting, which will slow you down.  Minimising your distractions, and knowing exactly where to find things quickly is always helpful, and a good habit to get into.  If you're in a shared office space, it's polite to keep your desk clear so that it's not distracting others.  A side effect of a clear desk is that it's easier to keep clean as well!", "source": "forum_qa"}

As with most interview questions, there is no right answer. This question is really is more about how you handle challenging situations than your coworker in this imagined scenario. You want to think about focusing on how you would communicate (both with manager and co-worker), be accountable for your work, and handle conflict. \n\nA useful strategy is first ask clarifying questions to the interviewer. Has the co-worker always procrastinated? Is this their first time or is there a pattern of bad behavior?  How will the co-worker impact you? Is there an upcoming deadline that you're on the hook for or in general your co-worker is lazy. Once you have a better understanding of the scenario, think about your answer. \n\nOne way to think about this is imagining what you would do in that situation. What is reasonable? Do you talk to your co-worker first and figure out what's going on? Do you go straight to the manager? Which is better and why? How will the co-worker's procrastination affect you? Can you ask other co-workers for help? For every choice you make, be able to justify it.\n\nAnother way to think about answering this is by putting yourself in the managers shoes. You have two employees working on a important project with a hard deadline coming up. From your point of view as manager, you don't really know much about how the employees are behaving, only if the project is finished and the quality of the project at the deadline. How would you (as manager) react if the project were to be incomplete or poorly executed by the deadline? Could it have been prevented? If so, what would you have expected from the employees (hint, status updates)? What are the qualities you expect in a good employee? If one is struggling or slacking, what you want the other employee to do? Based on that, is there anything you'd do differently as an employee?", "source": "forum_qa"}

A Bachelors degree is the entry level requirement, and most teachers acquire a Masters at some point, as well. High school teaching is about the subject area, more so than what's called the \"whole child\" at elementary/middle school levels, so you'll need to have an English major in college.

Recommendation letters and networking is obvious, but what other benefits can come from maintaining a strong bond with your professor?\n\n\nit is  very important to maintain a good positive professional relationship with all your professors along the way from community college to your post doc. grad. studies.\n\n\nAs class sizes across the country continue to rise, many colleges and university students are struggling to connect with instructors. As these institutions try to combat some of the potential issues of over-sized classes, or to even further benefit from smaller classes, as a student you should and  must strive to build positive working relationships with all your instructors. \n\n\nIdeally, students should try to develop a close academic relationship with mentor professors, who can use their higher academic rank and knowledge to help you negotiate thru programs, plenty of open opportunities for professional development, and the world of academia during your tenure of student and afterwards when graduating and ready for your 1st big new position or your 1st research project.  \n\n\nNow during your time as a student it is In building positive student-instructor relationships, students can gain more personal assistance, work through course material more effectively, and are ultimately able to perform better in the course. One of the primary benefits of building effective relationships with an instructor is a student’s ability to receive more specific feedback and instruction, whether you are taking pre-requisite or elective courses. Students who establish positive professional relationships with instructors can obtain more insight on how to create a specific course plan for increased progress. \n\n\nyou should meet with your instructors after large assignments or tests are returned. A “mini-conference,” or meeting with an instructor, provides both of you with an opportunity to focus on the finished final assignment, essay, or test. With this idea,it also asserts,this approach may seem time-consuming, it rarely becomes a daunting process but once some of your major problems have been identified and correction methods have been explained, you then begin to use the specific information you have received to self-monitor all your (work).” \n\n\nAdditionally, the more you meet with instructors early in the course, the less time you will need to meet with an instructor later on in the course – as you have already solidified your course fundamentals. \nAlso, in meeting with instructors individually, you can understand what to focus on for further improvement, which can in turn allow the whole-group class time to run more smoothly and effectively. \n\n\nIn addition to helping you with course work, building positive relationships with your instructor also allows you to foster a positive interaction that can open up the opportunity for dialogue if a disagreement later arises. \nWhether you disagree with a designated grade, or disagree with an instructor’s course content or teaching strategies, a strong relationship, established early in the course, can allow you and your instructor to more fruitfully negotiate any potential concerns.\n\n\nMeeting with your instructors individually is one of the best ways to establish a positive working relationship. Individual conferences and thorough evaluation make it possible to clarify specific concepts that, for a particular purpose, may not have been clear from the text or general classroom discussion.\nIn meeting for a conference, you are able to ensure that where you are at is on pace with the rest of the class, and may even judge how to make the class more challenging or beneficial by investigating supplemental texts or advanced assignment opportunities. So meeting individually with your           instructors also provides the Professor with an opportunity to give positive written and oral feedback to you and even the entire class. When ever you engage in this type of process and receive specific information, you will be able to and can focus on improvement and build on strengths.\n\n\nThe best way to meet with any instructor for a conference or meeting is to meet during the Professor's office hours. You probably aren't going to get very far if you try to talk to your professor immediately before or after class Instead, drop by to see him during his regular office hours after you send him an email to request an appointment. Your professor will be able to devote more attention to the issues you wish to discuss if you email in advance with your concerns to confront him at that appropriate time of his office hours. \n\n\nNow here is the scope of interacting you need to understand.As undergraduates, students most often interact with professors at a distance during classroom lectures; if professors and undergraduates do interact one on one outside classrooms, they typically do so in brief office visits or elevator conversations. Unlike undergraduate students, graduate students interact with professors much more often. \n\n\nMentorships with professors are very important for the academic success of graduate students, particularly when graduate students write their theses or dissertations. Unfortunately, many factors threaten healthy academic relationships between graduate students and professors. These factors include :\n(a) competition within departments, \n(b) different perspectives and opinions between students and professors, \n(c) professors’ forgetting students’ struggles, and students’ misunderstanding professors’ struggles, \n(d) and lack of communication, resistance to change, unclear expectations, and potential prejudices on either side. \n\n\nTo avoid any of these issues with potential mentors in graduate school, you can try the following:\n\n\nRemember that you are the one factor that you can control concerning academic relationships in graduate school. \nThe most important thing you can do to maintain healthy relationships with your professors in graduate school is to improve your sense of self and your self-esteem. \nYou can improve your sense of self and your self-esteem by maintaining a healthy social life with your family members, friends, and partners, by setting goals for yourself and rewarding yourself when you achieve those goals, and by being confident in what you have accomplished and how you can contribute to further academic progress. \nYou can also improve your confidence and sense of self by working on your own communication skills, which will benefit you for your entire academic and professional careers.\n\n\nIf possible, try to find or create academic environments:\n(e.g., classrooms, clubs, meetings, support groups, etc.)\nthat are open to and welcoming of dialogue. You can help create academic environments that facilitate conversation by understanding your professors’ expectations of you, by researching their interests and their classroom and communication styles, and by acknowledging the pressures they face within their own departments. When a good opportunity presents itself, you can also use your improved communication skills to initiate intelligent and informed discussions with your professors.\n\n\nHealthy mentorships in graduate school can take many forms. You can improve your chances of maintaining healthy academic relationships in graduate school if you remain open to and positive about potential sources of support.And again remember that Ideally, students should try to develop a close academic relationship with mentor professors, who can use their higher academic rank and knowledge to help you negotiate thru programs, plenty of open opportunities for professional development, and the world of academia during your tenure of student and afterwards when graduating and ready for your 1st big new position or your 1st research project.  \n\n\nNow during your time as a student it is In building positive student-instructor relationships, you will and  can gain more personal assistance, work through course material more effectively, and are ultimately able to perform better.", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: What kind of loans are best to search for?\nWhen applying for loans to finance college, which types of loans are best to apply for? Will there be more competition for the subsidized loans? #student-loans\nAnswer: Student loans can come from the federal government or from private sources such as a bank or financial institution. Loans made by the federal government, called federal student loans, usually offer borrowers lower interest rates and have more flexible repayment options than loans from banks or other private sources. You will not have to start repaying your federal student loans until you graduate, leave school, or change your enrollment status to less than half-time.  If you have trouble repaying your loan, you may be able to temporarily postpone or lower your payments.    You may be eligible to have some portion of your loans forgiven if you work in public service. \n\nHere's a quick quick read for more info:\nhttps://studentloanhero.com/featured/how-do-student-loans-work/", "source": "forum_qa"}

Will a college not accept you because you haven't visited their campus or taken a tour?  #college #admissions #campus\nAnswer: The short answer: it depends on the school\nSome schools have \"on site admission days\" when a student can visit the campus and apply that same day. Although they will still look at your academic profile, the fact that you are physically there and showing interest may certainly increase your chances of admission. If that is the case, you will want to make sure you do your homework and research the school as you will want to indicate why you want to go there and what you plan to bring to the campus community. \nOther schools require an in-person interview. This, paired with a tour, will be time well spent as if shows you are committed to the admissions process.\nTouring a school is also great because you may have the opportunity to strike up a conversation with an admissions counselor.

Another example is in the criminal justice system.

Instead of mentioning critical thinking skills by itself, identify a project or a previous work experience where you were able to use your critical thinking skills to solve a problem.  Focus on putting these skills into the Experience or Education sections of a resume, not a separate skills section,\nDon't be afraid to describe the event and how you were able to showcase the skill. If you know the law school is known for a particular area (for example, corporate law), showcase your interest in corporate law, learning corporate law, or experience in a corporate setting.\nAlso, highlight activities and events you took part in while at school. Don't be afraid to mention a one-time event if it left an impression - show the law school admissions team that you have experience or desire to experience different things.", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: What is expected with resumes?\n#resume expectations\nAnswer: A resume should be visually appealing. The font should be neither too large nor too small.  The use of bolding and underlining should be kept to a minimum, to call attention to only the most important items (job title, for example). It should not look \"crowded.\" There should be no spelling or grammatical errors.\nThe purpose of the resume is to get you the interview.  First, read the job description! Secondly, look at the company's website to gain an understanding of the company's business. The resume should show that you meet most of the requirements - that you possess the knowledge, skills, and abilities to do the job. Try to find ways to demonstrate that you have a skill, rather than just saying that you do. For example, if it is a job in an un-airconditioned warehouse doing heavy lifting, the fact that you were on athletic teams could help. If it requires strong math skills, being a volunteer GED Math tutor demonstrates this. \nDon't overlook school, sports, and volunteer activities as a way to demonstrate you have what it takes. If you worked a refreshment stand at the games, that demonstrates customer service and cash handling. \nWhere many people go wrong with resumes is they try to turn them into autobiographies. The focus needs to be on how you qualify for that particular job.  Also, remember that the purpose of business is to make money. Try to demonstrate how you can help the company make or save money. This is through things like safety, attendance, customer service, accuracy, speed, regulatory compliance (carding when serving alcohol, for example). \nBest of luck!\nKim", "source": "forum_qa"}

You’ll need to work with your loan servicer to apply for deferment or forbearance; and be sure to keep making payments on your loan until the deferment or forbearance is in place. \nBasically if you are in a situation where you are unable to afford your loan payments, a forbearance will keep you from defaulting.

Think about activities that relate to whatever you are teaching.  You might also ask a student each day to be prepared to teach the class something related to a specific topic the next day.  Students will want to hear what their fellow students have said and you can have students give positive feedback on what they learned from the student.\nRather than asking the entire class a question and having one student answer, often have them pair up in groups of 2 or 3 and ask each other the question and then be prepared to report to the entire class.  Do this several times within one class but ask them to move around so they are talking to a different student or group each time.  Moving around will keep them from falling asleep!!\nOccasionally bring in little treats like candy bars and use them as incentives for the best answers or whatever you hope to accomplish on that day.  And no matter what happens, try to encourage and reinforce all of their positive behaviors.  Even though they may not appear interested, they will be learning much from how you make them feel.\nWith every good wish!", "source": "forum_qa"}

Only 29% of all Americans are qualified to join the military. (http://time.com/2938158/youth-fail-to-qualify-military-service/) If you are doing it for the college money, you are doing it for the wrong reason. If you can join the military, it will be a change to your way of life. You will be taken away from your home and stripped of what you know. You will be given tools to be successful and learn to put others before your own. Here is an idea, if you want to go to college and serve the military, join the Reserves. You will gain valuable skills, stay in or around your current location, and they will help pay for college.  FYI- Joining the military is not like the movies. Movies are made to sell tickets.

While many entrepreneurs may view the challenge from competitors as a setback, you should see them as validation. In the tech industry, companies compete and partner at the same time, all the time.

If you take a “whatever” attitude towards studying, you are doing harm to your friends as well, as you may influence their study habits and behavior.\nIt is vitally important that you realize with total clarity that despite what anyone ever told you, you are not competing against your classmates and friends in exama. This kind of thinking is primitive, foolish and highly misguided. \nMillions of students take exams every single year! The thought that you are competing against your friends is silly and you shouldn’t fall for it. Remember that so many students take this test that any actual competition between you and your classmates is beyond trivial.\nOnce you realize that there is no real, actual competition between you and your friends and classmates, the option of cooperation opens up. Why study alone if you have friends that are better at given subjects than you are? By cooperating with one another, it is possible to not just break down the exam, but to also pull on one another’s strengths and help with one another’s weaknesses as well.\nStudy Group Pros\n1) Learn more as you can break down the test and study materials and split them up.\n2) Pull on one another’s strengths\n3) Get help with your weaknesses\n4) Learn to see the test and test questions in different ways\n5) Pull on collective resources, such as study guides and so on.\nStudy Group Cons\nUnfortunately there are some cons to forming a study group for the SAT. Let’s take a look a few of these cons.\n1) There will be differing levels of seriousness among your friends.\n2) There is a risk that your study sessions could deviate into socializing instead of working.\n3) Not everyone will pull his or her weight equally.\n4) Egos may get in the way and interfere with overall progress.\n5) People may not stick with the study group long enough to get the desired results and to justify the time it took to start the group in the first place.\nYou need to be sincere and mature to assess and handle group studies environment - All the best :)", "source": "forum_qa"}

The idea is that you can pay taxes upfront rather than when you withdraw funds at retirement. It is great to use when you are young because you would assume you will be in the lowest tax bracket at the beginning of your career rather than at the end of your career when you retire.

And most importantly, is the effect you're having on the lives of others worth it?\r\n\r\n#social-work #social-services\nAnswer: Do you mean the outcome for the client or for the worker?  The concept and evaluation of \"worth\" is a personal one.  After working a few years as a social worker you'll get a feel for what you find meaningful in your work.  It's so different for everyone.  Helping people with their well being is worth it for them and for you if you value well being.  \nWhen you mention \"hours\" do you mean the hours it takes to become a social worker?

Though they require at least four years of college, there are several careers available that cater to the interests of those who are passionate about unlocking the secrets of DNA and genes.\nAds by Google\nStart Download - View PDF\nConvert Any File to a PDF. Get the Free From Doc to Pdf App!www.fromdoctopdf.com\nGeneticists\nBiological scientists who study genetics in a medical laboratory are sometimes referred to as geneticists. Geneticists look for genetic causes of diseases, and explore how genes might be manipulated to improve human health. One well-publicized project that geneticists have been working on for several years is the Human Genome Project, an effort to map the complete genetic code of human beings. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a career as a geneticist usually requires a Ph.D. While the BLS does not track specific wage information for geneticists, biochemists and biophysicists reported an average income of $89,470 in 2012.\nAnimal Breeders\nAnimal breeders work in agriculture, carefully selecting parents in order to produce desirable traits in offspring. For example, horses may be bred for strength or speed, while cows may be bred for milk production. Breeders must keep meticulous pedigrees of animal traits in order to breed successfully. Animal breeders usually need a bachelor's degree in either genetics or animal science. As of 2012, these workers reported an average income of $37,230.\nPlant Scientists\nPlant scientists study the genes of plants used in agricultural. By manipulating their genetic code or breeding them, they can produce plants that have better yields, are more adaptable to certain climates, or are more resistant to insects or disease. Some work for large agricultural firms, while others work in research and development firms or at colleges and universities. This career usually requires at least a bachelor's degree. As of 2012, plant scientists earned an average income of $63,290.\nGenetic Counselors\nGenetic counselors work primarily in hospitals, medical offices and other healthcare facilities. They meet with patients to assess their risk of inheriting or passing on genetic defects. They begin by collecting family medical history and conducting a pedigree. Once a diagnosis has been made, they help patients understand how a condition is likely to progress. Genetic counseling careers require a master's degree in genetic counseling. As of 2012, the average annual income for this career was $55,820.", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: Do colleges value holding a job in high school?\nIm wondering whether or not it would be beneficial to get a job. #job\nAnswer: Strong Scores on Standardized Tests. Of those colleges and universities that require the SAT or ACT as part of your application — and a small (but growing) number of schools do not — admissions counselors seek scores that match of exceed the scores of their current students. For better or worse, standardized college entrance exam scores are seen as the most objective measure of your college potential. In the process of conducting your research on colleges, you should easily be able to find a profile of the most recently admitted class. (Note: colleges that do not require a standardized test for admission consideration do usually require supplemental materials, such as a graded paper from a core academic course and a portfolio that showcases your strengths, interests, and achievements.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Grade Point Average. It goes without question that grades are an extremely important element of your college application. Colleges will ask you to submit official transcripts from your high school and possibly recalculate your grade point average based on some internal system they use for weighting different types of courses. Your goal, from the first year of high school forward, is to achieve the best grades you can. If you had a rough freshman year, but have since rebounded with much stronger grades, fear not, because colleges certainly look for trends in academic achievement — and a record of constant improvement when your GPA is not as strong as you would like is a good sign to most admissions counselors about your growth and potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenging College-Prep Courses. Your challenge is not just to get the best grades you can — but to get the best grades you can in the most academically challenging courses as you can. You certainly do not need to enroll in an International Baccalaureate (IB) Program at your high school, but where you have the strengths, skills, and aptitude, you should at least strive for Honors or Advanced Placement (AP) courses. Most colleges will place greater weight on these “tougher” courses — and even go so far as to rate a B in an advanced class (IB, Honors, AP) on a higher scale than an A in a comparable mainstream class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Percentage of Class Standing. Class rank and class standing are moving a little further to the back of the pack, partly because class rank means almost nothing in high schools that are at the extremes — horrible or exceptional. In some of the top high school programs, class rank has been found to actually hurt some of the very best students — because only so many can be in the top 1, 5, or even 10 percent of the class. Grades obviously drive class rank, so you should of course strive for the very best grades — and then just hope that the ranking works in your favor or that the colleges you apply to don’t use rank as a top criteria for admissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership Positions in a Few Organizations. Most colleges and universities are seeking leaders from within their applicant pool, and you can make your application stand out by having one or two leadership positions over the course of your high school career. Being a leader in one or two organizations means much, much more than simply being a member in 10 clubs and organizations. Not only does leadership show a certain level of maturity and character, but colleges also have an eye to all their student organizations and their need to recruit future leaders. You don’t need to be the president of an organization, but you should be an officer of at least one group by the time you’re a senior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Involvement in Community Service. There’s no requirement for community service to gain admittance to college, but just about all college-bound high school students have jumped on the bandwagon, volunteering throughout the local community. It seems to be one of these unwritten rules that applicants who volunteer many, many hours in the service of supporting others will become a key campus activist. Regardless of the importance for admission to college, most experts agree on the value and self-fulfillment people get in helping others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsightful and Well-Written Essay(s). Of all the 10 items on this list, the essay either gets the most attention or the least respect — depending on who you ask. Like some of the other 10 elements on this list, not all colleges require an essay as part of the admissions application. The essay — or essays — are a tool used by some universities to learn more about you and why you want to attend their school. Definitely take the time to carefully consider the questions and write, edit, rewrite, and proofread your essays — with an eye to what the essays reveal about you and your personality. Some admissions counselors admit that an amazing essay can push a marginal applicant into the accepted student group. Learn more about college essay writing in our article, Writing the Successful College Application Essay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality Recommendations from Teachers and Guidance Counselor. The recommendation letters that you ask your teachers and your guidance counselor to write can play a key role in your college application. Ideally, you have a few favorite teachers — teachers who not only know the quality of your work and academic acumen, but also can talk about some of your personal qualities. It’s best to ask your teachers for letters as early as you can so that they have the time to write a quality letter; obviously the most popular teachers will need even more time if they have requests from many of their students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelevant Recommendations from Professionals and Others. One other nice touch — especially for a college you really want to attend — is to ask a professional such as a former (or current) boss to write a letter of recommendation for you. Even better if that person has some sort of tie to the college as a donor or alumnus. Other possibilities include your supervisor from one or more of your volunteering/community service projects or a coach from one of the teams you have played for. If you have run your own business, you might ask a favorite customer to write a letter. Finally, you can also ask a family friend or religious leader to write a letter — but personal references are not as strong as academic or professional ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork and Entrepreneurial Experiences. While you certainly do not need to have ever held a part-time or summer job or started your own business, if you have some unique experiences, writing about your experiences can be a great essay topic as well as showcasing your professionalism and time-management skills. College admissions folks love self-starters — applicants with a strong entrepreneurial spirit — so proudly tell the story of your babysitting, lawn mowing, car detailing, tutoring, painting, or pet-sitting business (or whatever YOUR business is).", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: which corse easy to study?\nfor future life\r\n #doctor #teaching #computer\nAnswer: It's helpful to take higher-level classes in Sociology, Psychology, and Human Development. Definitely take at least two or more 2000+ level courses in these subjects. You will learn about society and how it functions in a way that may be harmful to our student and how to combat social constructions and become more aware of them. This will make you a better teacher in the long run and having and understanding of sociology as a whole will make you a better person, help you understand your students and connect with them. Studying psychology and human development will help you learn about the way people learn (and therefore you will learn how to best teach your students). Depending on the phase of life adolescents and children are in, they learn differently, and their brain works differently as well. It is essential to have an understanding of this prior to becoming an educator. It will also help you to connect with students, parents, and families. Human Development and Family Studies will also allow you to become more culturally aware of students and families that come from different backgrounds; this will allow you to unlearn implicit biases and recognize them in yourself and others (and therefore, grow from them). Overall, these three fields of study are absolutely essential when pursuing teaching. Taking the time to take 2 or more classes in each of these subjects will help you become the best teacher you can possibly be. Other than these, the more obvious answer is take as many classes as possible in the subject-area you want to teach AND take education courses.", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: What is the difference between a pharmacist and pharmacologist?\nWhat types of science courses are taken? #medicine #pharmacy #pharmacists\nAnswer: PHARMACY\n\n\nPharmacy is a licensed health profession in which pharmacists provide information regarding medication to patients and health care professionals. Pharmacists are “medication experts”, concerned with disease state management and safe guarding the public’s health in matters relating to medication distribution and use. To practice pharmacy in the U.S., all new graduates must earn a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree and pass a state license examination.\n\n\nWhile responsibilities vary among the different areas of pharmacy practice, the bottom line is that pharmacists help patients get well. Pharmacists practice in nearly all areas and specialties in healthcare – sometimes behind the scenes and not obvious to the public eye, but as the medication expert on the healthcare team, pharmacists are necessary in all facets of healthcare. Pharmacist responsibilities include a range of care for patients, from dispensing medications to monitoring patient health and progress to optimize their response to medication therapies. Pharmacists also educate patients on the use of prescriptions and over-the-counter medications, as well as provide population based care in institutional settings. Pharmacists educate and advise physicians, nurses, and other health professionals on medication therapy decisions. Pharmacists also provide expertise about the composition of drugs, including their chemical, biological, and physical properties and their manufacture and use. They ensure drug purity and strength and make sure that drugs do not interact in a harmful way. Pharmacists are medication experts ultimately concerned about their patients’ health and wellness.\n\n\nProfessional Commitment: The principal goal of pharmaceutical care is to achieve positive outcomes from the use of medication that improves patients’ quality of life with minimum risk. Pharmacists are professionals, uniquely prepared and available, committed to public service and to the achievement of the followings goals. Pharmacists strive to:\n\n\nCure disease;\nEliminate or reduce symptoms;\nArrest or slow a disease process;\nPrevent disease;\nDiagnose disease; and\nAlter physiological processes for desirable result in the patient’s health\nPHARMACOLOGY\n\n\nPharmacology programs differ from pharmacy degree programs. A degree in pharmacology does not prepare graduates to practice pharmacy in the U.S., whereas, a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree does. Pharmacology programs are offered both in U.S. colleges and schools of pharmacy, as well as other institutions. AACP does not track the availability of pharmacology programs. For information about research careers in pharmacology, visit the web site for the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.\n\n\nPharmacology is defined as the study of the interaction of drugs with living systems. Pharmacology is an essential component in the study of pharmacy and is included as one of the six major areas of instruction in the pharmacy degree curriculum. Student pharmacists study pharmacology to learn the effects of various doses of medicinal substances, as well as the different ways in which medicine can be introduced into the body. The effects of poisons and the means to overcome them are studied in toxicology. Generally, animal tests are required to learn the strength of drugs. Physicians know a great deal about pharmacology and toxicology; yet, as the expert about medications, the pharmacist must maintain this knowledge to an even greater extent. This subject has a fascinating history and continues to be relevant in modern times. It deals with a number of questions. For example:\n\n\nWhat is the molecular site of action,\nWhat are the changes caused by a drug in the normal function of tissues and organs,\nWhat is the relationship between the dose of a drug and its effect,\nHow do drugs produce their effects, and\nWhat happens to drugs once they enter the body?\nSince a drug is traditionally defined as a chemical that interacts with living systems, this subject has a very broad relevance from its obvious importance in the diagnosis and treatment of disease to the impact of abuse substances or environmental chemicals on societies.", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: What is sound engineering, and how to become one?\nWould like to know what to study to become a sound engineer. #sound-editing\nAnswer: Step 1: Research Audio Engineering Duties and Education\n\n\nAudio engineers, also known as sound engineers, are responsible for producing quality sound at live performances, in recording studios and through other mediums such as radio and podcasts. As an audio engineer one of your main duties might be balancing the sound of all audio equipment plugged in during a performance, such as microphones, amplifiers, speakers and PA systems. As an audio engineer, you must be technically capable with both analog and digital equipment and must work with an extreme level of precision. To become a professional, you'll usually first need to attain an associate's or bachelor's degree in the field.\n\n\nStep 2: Prepare For an Audio Engineering Education in High School\n\n\nAccording to College Board, if you want to pursue a career in audio engineering you should take courses in electronics, computers and physics while in high school (www.collegeboard.org). You might also consider gaining experience with your school's music or theater department. You can work behind the scenes on sound, video or lighting.\n\n\nStep 3: Earn an Associate's or Bachelor's Degree\n\n\nAs an aspiring audio engineer, you should enroll in an associate's or bachelor's degree program in audio engineering or production. A few subjects that you can expect to learn about include connecting cables, operating a mixing board, mixing music and sound effects, placing microphones, troubleshooting sound problems and mastering techniques. Because so much sound design is created digitally using computers, you'll also need to master various audio software programs such as Pro Tools and Logic.\n\n\nStep 4: Complete an Internship\n\n\nAs a future audio engineer, you can learn more about audio engineering concepts while working for free at a recording studio, music venue or a radio station. The Audio Engineering Society suggests that students complete an internship or apprenticeship to gain hands-on experience, which will make them more marketable to potential employers (www.aes.org). This can sometimes be accomplished through placement programs at various colleges, universities and technical schools you may end up attending for your degree.\n\n\nStep 5: Find a Job as an Audio Engineer\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), as an audio engineer you should be able to find jobs at various places such as recording studios, sporting venues, theaters, movie sets and music video shoots (www.bls.gov). However, the BLS also stated that between May 2012 and May 2022, the number of jobs available in the field for sound engineering technicians is predicted to increase by only one percent. When it comes time to seek employment, try looking through the job listings or utilizing the networking functions of organizations such as the Audio Engineering Society and the Society of Professional Audio Recording Services.", "source": "forum_qa"}

The time line for completion of the doctorate is 5 to 6 years, perhaps longer. Getting into a PhD program in clinical psychology is very competitive. In other words you must be a stellar student with very high GRE scores (the GRE is the entrance exam for graduate school).

They patrol the areas they are assigned, which sometimes include entire jurisdictions, respond to calls, enforce laws, make arrests, issue citations, and occasionally testify in court cases. They often make traffic stops, respond to domestic disturbances, and, at times, provide first aid to someone involved in a traffic accident or injured in a domestic dispute until paramedics arrive. Much of their time is divided between patrolling, writing reports, and filling out forms. In fact, police officers now also perform the immigration duties once exclusive to INS agents, meaning that INS agents are now essentially police officers.\n\n\nResources: \nhttp://www.criminaljusticeusa.com/police-officer/\nhttps://fayettevillenc.gov/government/city-departments/police/recruiting/requirements-hiring-process", "source": "forum_qa"}

A simple question, right? But if you ask different people, you might get a different answer each time.\n\n\nWhile there are exceptions, in general, a page is fine. Of course, there is a lot to cover in a page. Alison Green of Ask A Manager has some great advice on how to ensure your cover letter stands out without being too long:\n\n\nThe litmus test is this: Does your letter make a compelling case for why you’d be awesome at the job, without repeating your work history?\n\n\nIf your letter does that but it’s longer than a page, look for ways to edit it down without losing its essence. If it’s half a page or less, you should just be damn sure that it’s truly passing that litmus test. It’s hard to meet that test if you’re writing very short. Not impossible, but a lot harder.\n\n\nRead the rest of her advice here.\n\n\nDetermining how long your cover letter will be is just one aspect of crafting an application. You have to figure out what will be in it. Here are a few tips to keep in mind:\n\n\nFollow any and all directions: Sometimes employers will ask you to answer questions in your cover letter. Regardless of how long your cover letter is, if you don’t follow directions, you risk not getting a chance at an interview.\nDemonstrate a genuine interest in the mission: Hiring managers value commitment to the cause and experience. Showcase both in your cover letter without simply repeating your resume. This also requires that you craft a unique cover letter for each position.\nShow some understanding of the role and organization: Demonstrate how and why you’re a great fit for both the job and the organization.", "source": "forum_qa"}

The key consideration when changing careers as a lawyer is the debt you have to pay off from going to law school (something around $100,000). So when switching careers, you have to make sure it is financially sustainable.\n\n\nThe good news is that because law training is mostly about analytically thinking (e.g., persuading, thinking quickly, writing clearly), your skills are broad enough that they can be used in many different fields, ranging from running a non-profit to becoming an entrepreneur.\n\n\nYou should think hard about whether a career in law is right for you--what do you want from life?

Have them identify what success looks like and have them evaluate if they meet their goal (keep all the focus on them).  Incentive could be a 5 minute break in the middle of class where they can stand up, close their eyes, talk to neighbors, etc. -- or if everyone agreed, they could save up those 5 minute breaks and end class early at the end of the week.  If you can make them feel like they have some control in how they are learning, you may have created a win-win situation.  Try to pair up those who are very interested with those who have no interest in various activities.  All the best to you!!", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: Grad School\nHow much will grad school cost?  #psychology #philosophy #creative-writing\nAnswer: Depends on the school, the subject and the time required.  Here is one example:\n\n\nAn MBA can cost about $75,000 - $100,000 depending on the school. \n\n\nLet's say it is $100,000 and you go full time for two years and give up your current job that pays $100,000.  \n\n\nSo, you have paid out $100,000 and given up two years of pay at $100,000 per year, or $200,000.  So, in this simple example the MBA cost about $300,000 assuming you have not worked during that period.\n\n\nOr, you can keep your job and go for an MBA at night and keep your job.  It might take longer, but it will cost less in dollar terms,  but more in terms of time invested.  \n\n\nThis is just a simple example for an MBA.

{"text": "Question: engineering\ndo they design softwares #engineering #computer\nAnswer: There are several paths to learning software design and starting a career developing software.  At some universities, software design is taught in a separate computer science department; elsewhere, computer science is part of the engineering department.  Either way, software design is considered to be an engineering discipline just like electrical or mechanical engineering.  Software design is a very interesting career that combines elements of engineering, psychology, and the graphic arts.  The part of the software that you see is called the user interface.  The user interface designer makes a series of drawings showing what the user interface will look like during various uses of the software, this work combines engineering and artistic skills.  The user interaction designer plans how the user navigates through the various views designed by the user interface designer, this work combines engineering with an understanding of how people think and work.  A software architect designs the internal parts of the software.  The user interface drawings, user interaction plan, and software architecture comprise the design of the software.  The design is passed to software developers who write the code that implements the software.  Software design appeals to people who like the combination of engineering and art.

{"text": "Question: computer science\nWhat does a day in the life a computer scientist look like?  #science #computer\nAnswer: Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.[1]\n\n\nIts fields can be divided into a variety of theoretical and practical disciplines. Some fields, such as computational complexity theory (which explores the fundamental properties of computational and intractable problems), are highly abstract, while fields such as computer graphics emphasize real-world visual applications. Other fields still focus on challenges in implementing computation. For example, programming language theory considers various approaches to the description of computation, while the study of computer programming itself investigates various aspects of the use of programming language and complex systems. Human–computer interaction considers the challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and universally", "source": "forum_qa"}

So, you meet your clients, judges, opposing counsel, staff, etc.\nYour staff will worship the ground you walk on.\nClients are often people you see at the worst times in their lives - they were fired from their job for no good reason, are accused of a crime they did or did not commit, had their kid removed from the home by child protective services,  are being sued for divorce, or violation the immigration laws.\n\n\nDealing with clients is challenging. They do not understand the legal process. You can help, by giving them a handout/guide as to what to expect. Who will they communicate with in your office to keep abreast of the status of their case? How? How often? These issues cause the most complaints against lawyers. Give them another brochure that explains the legal process for their particular case, and some of the terminology. Lawyers are really bad about communicating! This is what turns good clients into bad ones!\n\n\nOpposing counsel can be cooperative or jerks. Sometimes when they are jerks they are just playing a role, advocating for their client.

{"text": "Question: what licence is required to be a Lawyer?\nl am career planning  #career #planning\nAnswer: The law is a profession like medicine, dentistry, nursing or accounting and in order to practice law you need a state license. The license is issued by the state in which you practice. The licensing process is generally administered by an organization called the \"state bar association\". The bar association administers a test to every prospective lawyer called the \"bar exam\" which he or she must past with a certain score before being granted a license to practice law. Sitting for the bar exam generally takes two days. One day consists of a multiple choice test covering various general areas of the law, like torts, contracts, property law, criminal law, evidence and constitutional law. This section is the same for every state. The second day generally consists of a series of essay questions that cover topics that are more state specific. It usually takes a few months for the exams to be graded. If you fail, you can usually appeal your results or you can retake the exam. \n\n\nIn one state (Wisconsin) you do not have to take the bar exam to be admitted to practice if you graduate from a Wisconsin law school that is accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). In most other states you need to graduate from law school before you sit for the bar exam. However, in California, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming you are also able to sit for the bar exam without first attending law school. This is called \"reading the law\" and if you can absorb all the law to pass the bar exam just from reading books, you can become a lawyer without going to law school. This is very difficult, takes a long time (usually years) and is not recommended. Most states also have what is called a \"character and fitness\" requirement meaning that the state bar also looks at your criminal history and ethical fitness to practice before granting a license. \n\n\nOnce you pass the bar exam for your state and the character and fitness review, you must pay an annual license fee of a few hundred dollars to maintain your law license. Some states also have a \"continuing legal education\" (CLE) requirement where you must complete classes to stay current in your proficiency to practice. Your license to practice may be revoked or suspended if you do not pay the annual fee, fail to keep up on your CLEs, or, in most cases, if you are convicted of a felony or you violate the state code of attorney professional conduct. \n\n\nIf you attempt to give legal advice to people or try represent someone in court without a law license, this is called the \"unauthorized practice of law\" which is a crime. Generally you are only licensed to practice in the state(s) where you pay your bar dues. You can be licensed simultaneously in multiple states but you will generally have to pay bar dues in each state and, in some cases, actually take the bar exam in those other states to get your license.", "source": "forum_qa"}

If the candidate is hired it means they have shown maturity, responsibility and positive energy. Therefore when two of these individuals who were deemed as mature, responsible and positive get into a scuffle in the workplace or outside the workplace, they have exhibited that they were never who they portrayed to be therefore both parties will end up in trouble.  Shouting matches are a little bit more palatable and may not result in real trouble besides a warning.

{"text": "Question: What is the work environment at a video game company?\nAre they playing game in the leisure time? Are they talk about games all the time during the lunch time? #video-games #game-industry\nAnswer: Very interesting question. You've spent countless hours immersed in your favorite computer or video game. The game's knockout graphics and realistic sound effects make you really appreciate the game designer's hard work. In fact, you might wonder if a game design career would be a smart career choice. With your top-notch computer skills, you're sure you can handle the challenge of creating story lines, characters and action sequences. Before you investigate this career further, it helps to get a picture of a game designer's working conditions.\n\n\nWork Hours :\nIf you're looking for a career with unpredictable work hours, you've probably come to the right place. In fact, you might want to keep an extra set of clothes on hand so you can freshen up after those deadline crunching all-nighters. Hard work does pay off, however, as Robin Hunicke proved in a “PC Magazine” 2011 profile piece. Hunicke snagged her first 15 minutes of fame as Design Lead for the MySims Wii game in 2007. Her success helped rocket her to an executive producer role at thatgamecompany.\n\n\nWork Setting :\nAt first glance, game designers seem to work in traditional office environments, with individual work stations and a central conference area. However, that's where the similarity ends. Game designers' computers are loaded with cutting-edge graphics programs that generate games' eye-popping visual effects. Sophisticated sound equipment can recreate virtually any existing sound or synthesize new ones designed to throw players out of their chairs. You might find the audio equipment contained in one central room but networked to all office computers.\n\n\nTeam Collaboration :\nYou'll definitely get to polish your collaborative skills as a game designer. When you're ready to pitch a game concept to your fellow team members, for example, you'll likely congregate around a central work table. You might even kick back at a picnic table under the trees, tossing back a few sodas and noshing on snacks from the office fridge. Most importantly, you're part of a cohesive development team, willing to burn the midnight oil to create a top-notch game that leaves its players coming back for more.\n\n\nPhysical Hazards :\nChoosing a game design career means you'll avoid many well-known workplace hazards. You won't have to worry about back strain from moving heavy boxes. You also won't need to protect yourself from chemical hazards or equipment injuries. However, spending extended hours at your computer can result in eyestrain or other visual problems. Typing countless lines of game instructions, or manipulating endless graphics elements to achieve the right effect, can make you vulnerable to nasty wrist and hand ailments such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Finally, your marathon work sessions may take their toll on your back health. You might avoid this last problem if your employer springs for seated chair massages.\n\n\nyou can definitely go through the below mentioned website for some valuable information on this career.\n\n\nhttps://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/games-developer", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: What is an ideal GPA to leave college with?\nJust wondering....#college #gpa ##grades #academic-advising #career-counseling\nAnswer: That depends on your goal. If you're primarily interested in being a strong job candidate, the MOST important thing is simply finishing your degree. There's a huge gap in employability between college graduates and people who've attended some college.\nThe NEXT most important thing, as Lindsay said, is having relevant work experience upon graduation. You don't need to know exactly what you want to do, but do an internship or two in a field that interests you (marketing, engineering, sales, IT, supply chain). Even if you decide a different direction, this will show employers that you have experience setting and pursuing goals in an office environment. \nTo your question, though, a 3.0 or higher will give your job application more credibility. Moreover, many professional graduate programs (MBA, M.Ed., etc.) have minimum requirements of 3.0 or 3.2. These requirements can sometimes be waived with a certain amount of work experience, but you want to keep the options open in the first place.\nFinally, if you're really aiming high, the top business and law schools (think Ivy League) want grades as high as possible. These programs often have exit salaries of 150K, and mid-career salaries of over 250K. The careers they prepare you for require long hours and often come with very high stress. Most people prefer more balance in their lives, so be honest with yourself before chasing these goals. That said, a 3.7 will give you a shot here, but a 3.9 would be preferable.", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: How difficult would it be to attend college full time as well as having a internship?\nWould it be wise to take on a full schedule at college as well as ha e an internship with a medical program? #internships #programs\nAnswer: College is already difficult on it's own, but most people have several other responsibilities to balance while in school. Your ability to handle an internship while enrolled full time will depend on your time management skills. If you can schedule your time responsibly between school and work, you should have no trouble keeping up with school while interning. \nIt's important not to over schedule yourself, but you could easily make time for all your responsibilities. Use a weekly calendar or agenda and schedule school time, study and homework time, work time, personal time, family time, and anything else you want to have time for. Make sure you know how much time you'll need to be successful in your classes, and don't allow yourself to get overworked at your internship. Ask to be scheduled for a specific amount of time, and be realistic about the time you'll spend with your other responsibilities. \nIf you're taking a particularly difficult course load in a certain semester, maybe cut back on hours spent at the internship or with friends. It can be a stressful juggling act, but if you are honest with yourself about your habits, and can stick to plans when you make them, you should have no trouble handling both school and an internship at the same time.", "source": "forum_qa"}
{"text": "Question: What are the benefits of being a teacher?\nWhat are the benefits of being a teacher? #teaching\nAnswer: Teaching is an exceptionally rewarding career, it is also an extremely difficult career. It's helpful to take higher-level classes in Sociology, Psychology, and Human Development. Definitely take at least two or more 2000+ level courses in these subjects. You will learn about society and how it functions in a way that may be harmful to our student and how to combat social constructions and become more aware of them. This will make you a better teacher in the long run and having and understanding of sociology as a whole will make you a better person, help you understand your students and connect with them. Studying psychology and human development will help you learn about the way people learn (and therefore you will learn how to best teach your students). Depending on the phase of life adolescents and children are in, they learn differently, and their brain works differently as well. It is essential to have an understanding of this prior to becoming an educator. It will also help you to connect with students, parents, and families. Human Development and Family Studies will also allow you to become more culturally aware of students and families that come from different backgrounds; this will allow you to unlearn implicit biases and recognize them in yourself and others (and therefore, grow from them). Overall, these three fields of study are absolutely essential when pursuing teaching. Taking the time to take 2 or more classes in each of these subjects will help you become the best teacher you can possibly be. Other than these, the more obvious answer is take as many classes as possible in the subject-area you want to teach AND take education courses.", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: What can be a good resume builder for a programmer?\nMany programmers can all write in different languages, so what is something that could be added to a resume to make one stand out more? #programming\nAnswer: Being a contributor to one or more open-source projects is an excellent way to show you have skills, both programming-wise and with respect to interactions with other team members, in a publicly visible way.  There are literally tens of thousands of such projects, most of which have known bugs, and fixing some of those bugs is a great way to get your foot in the door.  (Such projects also frequently need more or better documentation, so consider doing some of that, too.)\nGetting an internship at a software company is also a good way to get started, and you'll even get paid!  But there are many fewer opportunities and a fair amount of competition, so that tends to be more of an option for second- or third-year college students in a computer science or software engineering program.\nOccasionally you may come across a web site for a small (perhaps one-person) local business that could use some love; if you've learned some Javascript and CSS/HTML skills, you might be able to offer your services in improving something their site.  (Or perhaps they're not scaling well enough; offering to help get them set up on Amazon Web Services or Azure or whatnot might be even more appreciated.)  That can be a tricky conversation to have, though (you're more or less telling the person who set it up that they didn't do a great job), so even if you spot such a site, it may come down to your people skills even more than your technical ones.\nFinally, you could consider setting up your own web site with some flashy but non-trivial demo (for example, there are some very cool 3D pages built on top of \nthree.js\n), or perhaps build your own Android app.  Both are more oriented toward \"front end\" development, but that's still development, and if you manage to do something meaty enough, it could do the trick.\nBut contributing to one or a handful of open-source projects that interest you--not necessarily the huge ones since they may be almost as tough to crack as the job market, but the small- to mid-size ones--is probably the surest way to stand out.

{"text": "Question: What is a hedge fund, and how do they differ from a investment firm?\nWould like to know what a hedge fund is.\r\n\r\n\r\n #investment\nAnswer: An investment bank (IB) acts as an intermediary between idle capital and businesses in need of capital. The IB takes a commission or a set fee for their analysis and placement services (which could include financial modeling, legal structuring, sourcing capital, etc.). These are transactional shops which are constantly sourcing capital and deals.\n\n\nThis is why it is called a \"bank\". Like the cash in your savings account, the bank takes your idle money and loans it out for mortgages, businesses, etc. The IB finds a home for idle money (on a larger and riskier scale).\n\n\nA hedge fund, by contrast, is an ongoing investment fund which is managed. The management firm takes a fee and/or a percentage of the profits of the fund.

{"text": "Question: So if you pass the GRE and you GPA is not super high can you still make it make it\nYour answer said it depends on the school. And the GRE and your personal statement  #higher-education\nAnswer: As the others wrote - different graduate programs/schools have  different ranges for acceptance into their programs. But also as they wrote - the acceptance decision is based on your whole application  - not just those 2 scores.  Grad programs often request an interview. That's a great way to show your interest and your intended persistence.   And letters of recommendation can make a big difference too. Try to get a letter of recommendation from someone who has graduated from the program(s) you're interested in. That may carry more weight when they see a recommendation from someone they know and someone who finished the program. And if your first choice school doesn't accept you, just try some different schools. Have at least 5 schools/ programs on your list.  Some schools will also take a grad students on probationary status if scores are low but the rest of the application is strong. And then when you successfully complete your first semester, you're taken off probationary status.  Also -you can retake the GRE multiple times ...so you could study or take a GRE \"help course\" and then retake it to bring your score up. Seeing you retook the GRE also can tell the folks making the admission decision how important being accepted into the program is to you.  Best of luck.

There are plenty of \"smart\" people who don't finish or even attempt graduate school.... persistence, above all else - matters.", "source": "forum_qa"}
{"text": "Question: How long does it take to pay off all of your student loans after medical school?\n#medical #student-loans\nAnswer: The length of time to pay off loans depends on a few factors. \n\nFirst how large or small is your loan burden. If you owe 100,000 or less it shouldn't take that long after residency. If you owe more that 200,000 you may need to strategize a comfortable payment method. \n\nSecondly it depends on the specialty you choose.  If your in a higher or lower paying specialty it will be a little more or less difficult to pay that loan. \n\nThird (post-medical school train) depending on how long your training is you loan will increase by a lot or a little because of interest accruing during residency.\n\nFourth do you have any help from family. \n\nFifth is the method your comfortable with when paying your loan off. If you want to start your life after training than you will pay a smaller amount per month to balance out other expenses like a mortage, kids or a new car.

Previously called “public relations” or “public affairs,” corporate communication has taken on new importance in the 21st century as a result of corporate scandals or crises at companies like Enron and Toyota.\n\n\nThe department usually oversees communication strategy, media relations, crisis communications, internal communications, reputation management, corporate responsibility, investor relations, government affairs and sometimes marketing communication.\n\n\nThe person running the department is the chief communications officer of the firm, and reports directly to the chief executive officer in many of the top global organizations due to the critical importance of the function today.\n\n\nFunctions of a Corporate Communication Department:\n- Media Relations\nThis may be the function for which corporate communication managers are best known. Media relations work includes writing and distributing news releases and responding to media inquiries. Corporate communicators oversee all planning for news conferences, including selecting the site for an event, arranging for banners and other graphics to be displayed at the event, preparing packets of information to distribute to the media and preparing executives to speak at news conferences. Media relations also involves arranging for spokespersons to appear on local television and radio programs. Corporate communicators monitor newspapers, television news broadcasts and other outlets to see what the media is saying about the company and to devise strategies to address misinformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic Relations\nBuilding relationships with customers and responding to inquiries from the public fall under the public relations function of corporate communications. Duties in this area include producing newsletters, brochures and other printed materials designed for the general public. Corporate communicators also manage a company’s website and social media presence, which includes monitoring what customers and clients are saying about the company on social networking websites and responding to inaccurate posts or requests for information. Communication professionals may respond directly to calls and emails from citizens and customers with questions about a company’s plans or activities. They arrange for speakers from the company to make presentations to local community groups and may facilitate group tours of a company’s operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrisis Communication\nWhen an event occurs that threatens public safety or a company’s reputation, corporate communicators function as advisers to CEOs and senior leaders in managing the crisis. Special training in the issues unique to crisis communication helps corporate communicators prepare for events such as chemical spills, violence in the workplace, an accidental death on the job, layoff announcements and allegations of company wrongdoing. They often work with staff throughout their organizations to develop crisis communication plans before disaster strikes. A crisis may require communications staff to work with attorneys, government regulators, political officials, emergency response personnel and communications staff from other companies when developing crisis messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Communications\nIn addition to conveying a company’s messages to external audiences, corporate communicators may also be called on to function as employee communications managers, which includes designing printed publications and writing emails to announce company news, benefits information and training opportunities. Corporate communicators may facilitate focus groups to learn what issues matter most to front-line employees. They advise senior leaders on how to improve relationships with their staff and gain support for their initiatives. The corporate communications staff may also manage a company’s Intranet and internal blogs.", "source": "forum_qa"}
{"text": "Question: Is a BS in nusing worth it?\nwondering.... #nurse #registered-nurses #nurse-practitioner #icu-nurse #nurse-management #hospitality-management #hospice-nurse\nAnswer: Yes, many employers pay more for bachelor's prepared nurses. In addition,  a bachelors prepared nurse has the ability to move easier into management positions or other positions they may desire, in their career lifetime. Nursing nationally has a goal to have all nurses obtain bachelor's degree by 2020. If you are deciding on associates or bachelor's, go for the bachelor's, it will pay off, both professionally and financially. \nMany nurses have gone through the decision of whether to earn an associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree. They pause and wonder, “Is getting a BSN worth it?” Before you can make that same decision, it’s important to understand the difference between the two, including education, job prospects and your potential career growth.\nOne of the main differences between earning your Associate’s Degree in Nursing and your Bachelor of Science in Nursing is the amount of time you will spend earning your degree and what your education will consist of.\nIf you went into a hospital and examined the nurses, it would be difficult to tell who had earned a BSN and who had earned an ADN. Many of these nurses will hold the same positions. Both BSN- and ADN-educated nurses can work as labor and delivery nurses, critical care nurses, or ICU nurses, amongst many other options.\n\n\nHowever, advancing your nursing career beyond those positions will require a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. This is the key difference that  makes getting a BSN worth it.", "source": "forum_qa"}

You can major in literally anything and apply to dental school (and some dental school's don't even require a bachelor's degree) but every dental school will require you to take the Dental Admission Test or DAT. The DAT has 6 sections (biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, reading comprehension, math, and perceptual ability). Being a biology, biochemistry, or chemistry major would definitely help when it comes time to study for the exam and a good understanding of the basic sciences will definitely help throughout dental school and with any research you may do while in dental school (doing research in dental school is recommended since it will help your application stand out when applying to an orthodontics residency). \nWish you the best of luck!", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: How to answer questions about salary expectations in interview?\nIn an interview, when asked about salary/wage expectations, what is the best approach in answering this question? \r\n\r\nPresumably, as an interviewee, it is probably not good for yourself to low ball the answer but as a potential employee, it probably sounds too crazy to expect the highest pay. \r\n\r\nWhat kind of answer would be fitting? What do employers look for?  #management #human-resources\nAnswer: The way you respond to the offer can change everything.\n1)  When negotiating a job offer is to keep things positive – even if the offer is one you’re having a great deal of difficulty drumming up enthusiasm about. Show gratitude for the offer and enthusiasm about the potential of the position before you dive into negotiating mode.\n2) Make your counter offer one that is fair, well-reasoned, and thoughtfully presented. CBS Money recommends providing a salary range as part of your counter offer – indicating that companies will often avoid offering the lowest range in an effort to avoid seeming impolite.\nThough if you do provide a range, make sure the bottom number is one you can live (and work) with. Providing a salary range also gives the employer the impression that you’re flexible – a trait they often prefer in employees.\n3) The third tip, and perhaps the most important when it comes to your long-term career goals, is this: be willing to walk away if the offer isn’t right for you.\nIt’s hard to do, especially in a competitive job market. If you’re not desperate to put food on the table or a roof over your head, though, it may be better in the long run to wait for the right offer, rather than simply taking the opportunity that’s available right now.\n4) Finally, keep in mind that some companies may have a limit on salaries they can offer, but that doesn’t mean they can’t offer compensation in other ways. If you get pushback on a higher salary, try negotiating for other benefits that could sweeten the offer for you:\nPerformance bonuses\nSigning bonuses\nFuture pay raises\nAdditional vacation days\nCompany stock\nRetirement contributions\nHealth benefits\nFlexible work hours\nSome people even negotiate for gym memberships. Only you can determine your priorities. If you’re reasonable with your requests, don’t be afraid to open up the discussion.\nThe bottom line: You don’t have to live in fear of interview questions about money or even a salary offer that’s on the low side of what you want or need. Following these tips will help you navigate the tricky waters of salary negotiations, while keeping your head above water.", "source": "forum_qa"}

What do employers look for?  #management #human-resources\nAnswer: If you really want the job, it's good to do some research before hand so you know something about the salary range for similar positions.  If you don't have time to do the research then ask the interviewer what the range is for the position.    Remember that most employers do not want to pay much over the mid-range for a position as that leaves little room for pay increases. Also employers typically ask on an application or in person what you are currently being paid or what you were paid in your last position.  Slightly below the mid-range is the safest answer if that meets your income requirements.  Asking above the mid-range when your past experience and pay don't reflect that kind of increase is unrealistic.", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: What skills are most useful or desired for a job in Human Resources?\nWhat skills are most applicable for a job in HR and what skills are employers looking for? #business #human-resources #hr #hr-consulting\nAnswer: As you consider your proficiency in each of the skills listed below, think about how you could represent them in an interview. This can help you frame each skills in a way that will impress hiring managers.\n\n\n\n\nRecruiting\n\n\n\n\nSearching for and attracting new talent is a major focus of the job for many HR professionals. If you are able to easily connect with others, uncover information, communicate clearly and be persuasive in negotiating contracts, you may be well-prepared to handle the very important task of recruiting.\n\n\nHow to highlight this in a job interview: Ask yourself if you’ve ever interviewed or evaluated a job candidate. Have you ever scouted an opposing sports team? Have you ever helped your boss with a job search or looked over a handful of resumes for a new nanny?  These experiences could all come in handy if you’re serious about getting into HR. \n\n\n\n\nScreening\n\n\n\n\n“Screening is the process of reviewing a person to go to the next step,” says Devay Campbell, founder and CEO of Career 2 Cents. When you screen applicants, for instance, you might look through a pile of applications to sort out the likeliest candidates for the job. In order for a candidate to advance in the hiring process, they must go through you.\n\n\nHow to highlight this in a job interview: “You may work or volunteer at organizations that allow you to serve as an intake person before sending someone to the next step,” Campbell says. She uses an example of a school newspaper where you might screen sources to see if they are right for the article. “The ability to analyze data and determine its relevance and validity could be demonstrated in school assignments or big projects.”\n\n\n\n\nEmployee relations\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful businesses thrive on secure employee-employer relationships and the professionals who support those connections. Being able to identify and resolve employee concerns as they develop creates a more satisfying work environment for employees and employers alike.\n\n\nHow to highlight this in a job interview: Ask yourself if there was a time when you were involved in a discrepancy between two individuals in a professional setting. How did you work to resolve their differences in a respectful, empathetic and efficient way? Be specific. Which soft skills were important to use? How did you address concerns and determine an outcome? \n\n\n\n\nOnboarding\n\n\n\n\nEmployee turnover is expensive. Onboarding refers to the process that allows new hires to become adjusted to the social and performance aspects of their new job quickly and smoothly. Companies are looking to hire HR professionals who can bring new recruits ‘onboard’ to increase the chance that they will settle happily and successfully into their new jobs for the long run. \n\n\nHR and recruiting revolve around relationship-building, according to Tiffany Brown, talent acquisition and development manager at FreightCenter, Inc. “HR team members are expected to not only build relationships with potential applicants, but also employees in every department throughout an organization.”\n\n\nHow to highlight this in a job interview: Brown looks for applicants with strong communication skills who can collaborate in a team environment and handle sensitive situations with tact. Think of onboarding as playing host to new employees. Share occasions where you helped someone feel at home or make a transition. Specific examples of taking initiative to prevent hard feelings and promote open communication between co-workers will speak well of your ability to thrive in an HR position. \n\n\n\n\nScheduling\n\n\n\n\nEmployers want HR candidates with scheduling skills because many positions require juggling and prioritizing tasks on a team or company calendar. It’s important to be able to create a plan that allows everyone to achieve their goals.\n\n\nHow to highlight this in a job interview: Ask yourself if you have experience planning a multistep project and how you had to strategically organize and prioritize time to complete each task along the way. This could have been for a wedding, graduation party or even a vacation overseas.  \n\n\n\n\nHuman Resources Information Software (HRIS)\n\n\n\n\nHR Payroll Systems defines HRIS (also known as HRMS) as “an intersection of human resources and information technology through HR software.” This allows HR activities and processes to occur electronically, making the workload lighter and more efficient for HR professionals.\n\n\nHow to highlight this in a job interview: Obviously if you are certified in HRIS or have taken any training, you’ll want to highlight that. If you lack experience in HRIS, showcasing other technological proficiency could go a long way. Draw attention to the fact that you’re eager to learn and can do so quickly. \n\n\n\n\nSocial media\n\n\n\n\nThis skill is popping up in more and more job listings nowadays. But it makes a lot of sense in HR. “Being on and participating in social media platforms shows that you are connected and visible,” Campbell says. She adds that if you work in a recruiting position, you’ll likely be using social platforms to seek out or screen potential job candidates as well.\n\n\nHow to highlight this in a job interview: Think about how you communicate on social media, or consider opening an account if you don’t engage with social media already. Do you understand the vibe of a given platform? If you had to cold call someone you wanted to recruit, would you know where to begin? \n\n\n“Having an established presence on social media sites will give you a head start,” Campbell says, adding that candidates and new hires can make use of social media to get abreast of industry best practices. \n\n\n\n\nPerformance management\n\n\n\n\nPerformance management is how a company involves its employees in improving effectiveness towards the accomplishment of company goals, according to The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The OPM lists performance management tasks, such as setting expectations for employees, monitoring performance, developing their capacity to perform, and rating performance. This skill relies heavily on strong communication and interpersonal abilities.", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: what is the annual salary for a broadway performer\nhow much is given, is it a lot for expensive luxury  #professor #singer #director #actors #broadway #dancers\nAnswer: To be in a Broadway show, you would need to be part of the Actors Equity Association.

{"text": "Question: What are some of the best schools in order to receive a business analytics degree?\n#business-analysis #college #analytics\nAnswer: <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">First is important to know that business analytics is the practice of iterative, methodical exploration of an organization's data, with an emphasis on statistical analysis. It is used by companies committed to data-driven decision-making. </span>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">That being said, is crucial for a student to start looking into what kind of specialization you will want to focus and see how the course requirements of each school relate to the field that you were thinking about. Asking for \"best schools\" one can easily tell you, well go to MIT, but being more realistic, it is all about perspective. A school is mainly its program, but you also have to look into things such as financial aid, room and board, probability of getting in. </span>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">A regular accredited school can do the trick if it's within reach for you, at the end of the day the student is going to be you, and it is for you to get the most out of the program. Just remember, college is not only about getting good grades, it is also about associating, being part of extracurricular activities. Join clubs, do some volunteering, find an intership and most importantly, enjoy your time there. </span>", "source": "forum_qa"}

Regulatory compliance - breaking laws results in fines (not carding people when selling beer, for example). \n\n\ncheck out this website for help in writing a resume, as it will also let you save it in various formats, and fax it. gotresumebuilder.com\n\n\nbest of luck!\nKim", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: How to decide between hardware and software design?\nBecause it's hard to decide between the two. #technology #computer-engineering #technician\nAnswer: This is a really insightful question as a lot of people don't even think about the difference.  There are a couple of ways of looking at the decision.\n\n\nFirst, you might look at the kind of things you enjoy.  Are you the type of person who enjoys working on things with your hands or things you can physically visualize?  If so, hardware may be closer to your interests.  Networks and hardware can be thought of like things in the physical world and are generally subject to similar constraints.  On the other hand, if you're someone who's comfortable and enjoys the idea of writing code that can do anything (but you can never actually touch it) then Software is probably for you.\n\n\nThe other aspect to the decision might be the type of company you want to work for in the future.  Many small companies and start ups have moved away from buying, designing and managing their own hardware/network because of cloud based offerings from companies like Amazon Web Services.  These companies tend to focus more on software and leave the hardware and networks to the big guys.  So, if you want to work in a small start up you may have a better chance on the software side of things.", "source": "forum_qa"}

If you're attending college purely for the love of learning and intellectual challenge, that degree may still work for you! If, however, you have a vocational goal in mind, you'll need to narrow your focus to at least an area of study that will help you get the background needed to either find a related job, or prepare for graduate school. The best major(s) for any student are the ones that create excitement and interest from just reading the course syllabus/description. If you're undecided at the beginning of your academic career, that's OK. Take some survey courses in several areas to help give you more information about those fields, and talk to people who work in them for feedback. There are some career fields where any type of degree \"counts\" as an entry level minimum, but those tend to be less well-paying than more specific degree areas.

No one starts running a marathon the first day, you need to train and work yourself up by running 5Ks, then half-marathons, then full marathons.  Just like in the workplace, any large endeavors or projects should be broken down into shorter goals and objectives with timelines, roles, responsibilities and success criteria outlined for each, with regular intervals of review and assessement to ensure the project is on track.  Same can be applied to your career path.  If there is a goal title or position you're seeking, outlining a roadmap of goals to get there in terms of training, education and work experience, will give you a stronger chance of achieving it.

{"text": "Question: What is more important? Your GPA or your experience?\nWhen prospective employeers look at your resume, Which qualification has a greater chance in the employee getting a job ?\r\n #college #career #jobs #resume #gpa\nAnswer: Unfortunately, as you might have guessed, there’s no straight yes or no answer. A lot of reasoning behind employer decisions regarding graduate applicants is dependent on the field itself: industry status, the employer and the project/position they’re hiring for. Some industries for example, such as Law and Accounting, have quotas graduates must meet in order to be eligible for a position straight out of uni. The big 4 accounting firms and big 6 law firms have a minimum GPA grade requirement that must be passed first in order to attain an interview. It makes sense for huge corporate conglomerates like this to have entry requirements. Given their huge size and the wealth of the marketplace they boast, they’re looking for recent graduates who will complement their business values and offer the best return for their salary. From there, a display of a strong work ethic paired with proven competence helps pave pathways for career growth. Because universities are pumping out so many more graduates than ever before, firms like these can easily afford to be picky.\n\n\nIt’s important to remember that big companies and industries like the ones mentioned, have fully fledged, developed and detailed graduate programs. Other industries like banking and engineering also offer extensive pathways for tertiary leavers. Graduate positions come with challenges. They’re fiercely competitive and have strict applicant guidelines that must be adhered to.\n\n\nSo, for those not pursuing a conventional career path, or rather, aren’t studying or looking for a position in the aforementioned fields, what should you value more in pursuit of a career?\n\n\nTo get an idea, take a look at Google’s HR approach. The search engine giant stated earlier this year that they believe high grade point averages to be a poor indicator of career success and not necessarily relevant to a graduate's full potential. However, a high GPA is still a great thing to have. At the end of the day, doing well in university highlights your ability to conduct thorough research, critically analyse information, be disciplined, work hard and achieve exceptional results. All things that are impressive in the eyes of employers when hiring a new staff member. Ben Reeves, head of the Australian Association of Graduate Employees, (AAGE), points out that employers want graduates who are work-ready and can grow in whatever role they are given. Marks are an important early indicator, but they aren’t the be all and end all.\n\n\nAssessments given in university differ vastly from the day to day responsibilities and challenges experienced in a full time specialised position. Reeves further highlights that while employers want smart and work ready employees, academic aptitude is a poor indicator by itself of whether a graduate will be a good fit for an organisation.\n\n\nFurthermore, a lot of businesses and firms don’t have the cash flow boasted by big corporate giants. They have limited budgets for training and development. Hiring someone who, while having a relative degree in the industry, lacks role specific skills and experience can mean it costs an employer money and productivity since they have to allocate considerable time to train and develop the new employee. The fact that they would rather hire someone with a few years experience right off the bat makes sense. Having experience sets a person apart from the sea of other graduates out there, which is important when competition is so fierce.", "source": "forum_qa"}

{"text": "Question: What should you study if you're a girl and want to work in tech?\nIs it harder for girls to work in technology than boys?  #technology #tech #women-in-tech\nAnswer: Why are maths and science so important?\n\n\nMost civil engineering projects need to be able to stand up to natural forces (like wind and water), and man-made forces (like vehicles, equipment and people). For example, civil engineers:\n\n\nDesign roads so they don't sink into the ground when heavy lorries drive along them\nBuild flats so they don't fall over when the wind blows\nConstruct tunnels so they don't flood when it rains\nYou need to be able to understand and measure forces and movement, and to calculate the strength of the structures you're designing. What you learn in maths and science – especially physics – will help you do this.\n\n\nThe structures that civil engineers design and build are mainly on the ground and have to be supported by the soil and rocks underneath them. The strength of the ground varies from place to place, and different rocks and soil have different properties (e.g. how quickly water drains through them). If you don’t want your structure to sink into the mud, you have to know about the various types of ground and design the right kind of foundations for the site. For this reason, studying geography or geology is also good idea.\n\n\nAs designers and innovators, civil engineers create things that didn’t exist before and do things in ways that haven’t been done before. They try to make our environment as attractive as possible by designing things that are interesting and pleasant to look at. They also make sure that these things blend in well with their surroundings. So if you're creative and enjoy art and design and technology, these would be good subjects to study too.\n\n\nCivil engineers usually work in teams and are often involved in projects in many parts of the world. This means that languages, teamwork and communication skills will also come in useful.", "source": "forum_qa"}

The work/life balance requires that they be comfortable being away from home, and that their spouse be willing to handle things at home when you are traveling.

Much of the detailed testing is done by full-time employees or even contracted out to service providers who follow detailed test plans and which involves lots of repetitive actions. You might test a quest boss fight by trying it with each character type, with each weapon, with each spell, etc. You might spend the day making each character jump out of a window to make sure they all react properly.\n\n\nBut you can also be the type of tester that checks the flow and entertainment value of the game.

At more advanced stages of testing, you will be responsible for addressing the game for what it is: software.  This means you will have knowledge of how software works and will approach testing a game in a methodical way, addressing areas of high risk and complexity with a strategic approach to find bugs faster, or find deeper issues instead of cursory issues.

{"text": "Question: Do possible employers look at all the schools you've attended?\nHow far back do employees look into your education? Is it more important to attend a bigger name graduate school to make up for a lesser known undergraduate or attend a more well established undergraduate school for it's reputation in a field? #employment-opportunities #employment-discrimination\nAnswer: Employers absolutely look at where you went to school, as do graduate programs.  Most often it's reputation in field that counts.  For example, Harvard has a great law school, business school, and medical school, but it's not as well known for music.  But the name alone sometimes does count for quite a bit, just because people can't always be bothered to know which school is better at what.  Grad school admissions departments have actual multipliers that they put on GPAs from undergrad schools based on things like grade inflation, curriculum difficulty, etc, so if you go to an easy school known to have a high average GPA, and you get a 4.0, it might be only worth a 2.8 to the graduate admissions process.  They have actual tables listing schools, programs, and multipliers to attach to GPAs.  That level of detail isn't often followed by companies, though.\n\n\nMost places don't care that much about high school.  There are too many, with too wide variation, for a company to care.  They might care about GPA, extracurriculars, etc, but once you graduate college it's best to not even put high school on your resume.", "source": "forum_qa"}

They are rooting for you, especially in moments of distress. It's scary to forget your lines, but the play must go on, and it usually does. In live theater mistakes happen all the time. Theater is a complicated business and there are all sorts errors that occur during performance. Props, costumes and scenery, lighting and sound cues can all break, fall off, miss their mark, fail to turn on or ignite, but Onward!

{"text": "Question: What's the difference between a major and a minor?\nAnd can you get them at the same time? #college #college-major #majors #college-minor\nAnswer: Credits. Majors and minors come down to credits - how many you need for your major and how many a minor might need. Let's say you need 60 credits for your major but an English minor may take 20 credits ( 4 - 5 courses). It's becoming very common to have two majors (that's a lot of credits!) or a major and a minor. If you can do it, do it. It's good for the resume and probably good for you especially if it's something that interests you.", "source": "forum_qa"}
{"text": "Question: What's the difference between a major and a minor?\nAnd can you get them at the same time? #college #college-major #majors #college-minor\nAnswer: A major is a specific course of study that leads to a degree be it a BA, BS, etc.  A minor is a course of study that typically complements a major. It isn't that difficult to complete a major and minor at the same time but there are factors to consider such as if you are working or participating in an internship at the same time which may limit your credit hours per semester or quarter.  In additional, you need to keep in mind the finances you have available because there could be additional credit hours to pay for.", "source": "forum_qa"}

What would it be? #business #medicine #marketing #financial-services #social-media #marketing-and-advertising #strategy #customer-service\nAnswer: Open a ROTH IRA and put in the annual maximum ($5,500).  If you do this, and if stocks rose an annual rate of 9% (which has been the average for the last 100 years), you'd have over a million in 30 years.

If you do this, you don't have to worry about \"saving up\" or even buying a house.  With other assets you might have, like a 401k, you can retire in your 50s.

A mechanical engineering degree can set you up to do will in all those areas but it's up to you what you choose to do.\n\n\nIt can vary depending on the job you go for.  Some mechanical engineers spend their time designing and simulating so it's pretty much a desk job.  Others go into production and it is more of a hands on job.  Others go into management, where their job is at the computer or in meetings.  Many jobs have a combination of all of these.

{"text": "Question: What is different for people in stem who get a dual-degree?\nJob search wise. Is there a greater chance in getting a job than those with one degree? #college\nAnswer: When students are entering into college or choosing their majors during their educational careers, they are faced with a lot of decisions. Choosing between a dual degree program and a major/minor program is one of them. What are the major differences between the two?\n\n\nThe Degree You Receive\nIf you have a major/minor, you are not really go to receive a degree in each of them. You might receive an English degree with a journalism minor or a Spanish degree with a political science minor, but you won’t have a degree in both subjects. However, if you opt for a dual degree program, then you will have a degree from each of the distinct subjects.\n\n\nNumber of Credits\nWhether you choose a major/minor program or a dual major, you are going to have to obtain more credits than if you just had one major. However, at some schools, a minor is going to be only 18 credits or so whereas a major could entail triple or quadruple that amount of credits. As a result, you could wind up staying in school for a much longer time if you chose to have a dual major as opposed to getting a minor.\n\n\nProgram Availability\nWhen you go to a college, you are going to have your pick from an array of majors. The selection pool from which you choose your first major is going to be the selection pool from which you choose your second. However, not all major programs are going to have a minor equivalent. For example, your school might have a minor in English but not in writing studies. If you have your heart set on a certain minor program, you must make sure that it is actually offered before enrolling in the school.\n\n\nFor The Job Market\nWhether you should opt for a major/minor program or a dual degree program is going to depend upon what the job market requires. Let’s look at some school teaching programs. Perhaps you want to teach high school mathematics. You are going to need one degree in education and one degree in mathematics. Many schools are not going to allow you to just minor in one of these subjects. Therefore, you must also find out what the demands of the job market are and what the requirements are for you to actually obtain a position in the field.\n\n\nThe Course Levels\nIf you are going for a dual degree program, then you are going to take classes of the highest caliber in both of these subjects. With a minor, you will take more of a mixed amount of classes, and you might not be able to get some of the advanced courses that you want. Again, specific program requirements can vary so be sure to look into yours.\n\n\nSome people use the terms “major/minor program” and “dual degree program” interchangeably, but they are absolutely not the same. In general, a dual degree program is going to better prepare you for a job in the specific field and provide you with more in-depth courses to enhance your knowledge.", "source": "forum_qa"}

Whether you are starting off at a community college or going from one four year institution to another - there is a large population of students that transfer before graduation. \n\n\nIf you are currently enrolled in a community college, take advantages of the resources they offer. Most schools have a transfer department right on campus and they will be able to help you pick a best fit school. \nSince you already have class experience, you should have more of an idea regarding the type of school you wish to attend, in or out of state, choice of major, etc.You can also use resources such as The College Board's Big Future search to determine what you are or are not looking for in a school.  Some community colleges also offer transfer fairs in the fall as well as visits from various colleges so students can speak directly to an admissions counselor. \n\n\nIf you are already attending a 4 year school and would like to transfer somewhere else, you will want to take similar steps. Although a 4 year school may not have the same on campus visits, you will still have an advisor who may be able to help you get the process going. \n\n\nNo matter where you begin you college career, the most important thing is - get involved. Unfortunately four year schools don't have the same pomp & circumstance for transfer students as they do for first time freshmen, but there are still opportunities to start making connections. Sometimes they host an activities fair so you can see different clubs and organizations or you can look for event posters and bulletins to see what is going on. If you live on campus, as friends in your dorm or the RA. Talk about your interests so you can make the most out of your experience! \n\n\n\n\nElizabeth Coccia", "source": "forum_qa"}

The Pell Grant is awarded to undergraduate students (graduate students are not eligible) who have not earned an undergraduate degree or a professional degree.

{"text": "Question: Do you ever get nervous when getting ready to perform? If so, what helps to calm the nerves?\nIn theatre, Movies, Television, and other acting-related things, do you ever come across nerves when getting ready to go on set? If you do, what helps you to get over it and just do it anyways? #art #acting\nAnswer: The circumstances of any scene in theatre or film is one in which the stakes are so high, the character enters the room with his heart pounding and palms sweating, so nerves are often very useful. As you continue to work more and more over time, your nerves will naturally deplete, as you gain confidence. The audience isn't going to hurt you; you've got something to give and they paid good money to see it. Of course, it is always overwhelming to be vulnerable in front of people, but this is a strength more than a weakness and overtime the satisfaction and the joy will greatly outweigh the fear. And most plays should as often as not allow you to admit to your own state of being to such an extent that your behavior can become the characters behavior. There are a myriad of different ways to calm nerves (remembering to breathe as others have said), but once you've gotten on stage, if you're still nervous, then your character is nervous, and you can admit to that, own that, and see where it takes you. And then the next night, you may be quite calm, and so your character will be calm. What makes your work valuable and interesting is who you are and how deeply and openly you can share your heart and soul within the circumstances of the story, so whatever you have to offer in a given moment, even if it's nervousness, has value.", "source": "forum_qa"}
