Also, the term ‘career ’ is often not adequate in contexts where options revolve\nmore around livelihoods. Beyond wording, however , the concept of ‘career guidance’  has been clearly\ndefined by internationa l organizations, as well as regional and international career guidance associations:\n‘Career guidance describes the services which help people of any age to manage their careers and to\nmake the e", "source": "Skills4Dev"}

Those skills entail traditional, practical CV writing skills, job\nsearching skills, and, most importantly , social and emotional competence.\nAs the literature featured in this issue sugges ts, career guidance should occur throughou t life: from primary\nschooling onwards at all levels, including lower and upper secondary education, vocational education,\nuniversity , and when working, being unemployed or not able to work. Guidance can be offered in several\nways: i) via structured  career education learning programs; (ii) through career centers  within education\nproviders, (iii) within public employment services, (iv) in outre", "source": "Skills4Dev"}

Career guidance is thus also a form of “sustainable\nactivation”: it differs from the type of short-term employment counselling, such as the one in public\nemployment services, that aims at matching  existing skills with open vacancies for immediate insertion.\nBoth are necessary services.

However, the results of a common method variance \nanalysis revealed that common method variance was not a problem for this paper: The averag e \ndifference between completing personality and passion items seemed long enough to minimise common \nmethod variance (Podsakoff et al., 2012).

As a result, the hospitality industry is facing a \nmassive labor shortage. Businesses closed due to the pandemic and hospitality employees were furloughed and laid off. As the industry \nspeeds into post-pandemic recovery, former hospitality employees have been reluctant to go back to their old jobs as they have \ndiscovered new opportunities with better work environments elsewhere. \nThe hospitality industry has always been characterized by high staff turnover. The reasons include long working hours, job \npressure, insufficient training, poor fringe benefit packages, poor leadership, and better opportunities elsewhere (Brown, Thomas, & \nBosselman, 2015 ; Fallon & Rotherford, 2010 ; Tracey & Hinkin, 2008 ).

Investigative interests are characterized by the preference for thought over action. \nThis interest is found among individuals who have an abstract and complex vision of their environment. In Artistic occupations, \nemployees work without explicit rules and express ideas in a creative manner (e.g., actor, floral designer, and photographer).

Enterprising interests are characterized by a willingness to persuade and influence others to achieve \nprivate and professional goals. These interests are strongly linked to status and power values. Finally, in Conventional occupations, \nemployees are required to be detail-oriented as they follow set procedures (e.g., receptionist, financial controller, or copy-editor). \nConventional interests correspond to valuing order and stability.

This relates to the notion of Person-Vocation \nfit (“P–V fit,” Kristof, 1996), which can be defined as the congruence between individuals’ occupation and their self-concept. Recent \nstudies have shown that P–V fit plays an essential role in employees’ job satisfaction and performance (Hoff, Song, Wee, Phan, & \nRounds, 2020; Van Iddekinge, Roth, Putka, & Lanivich, 2011). \nIn order to explain the links between personality profiles and job profiles, Viswesvaran (2003) proposes using the Attraction-Se -\nlection-Attrition model (“ASA model,” Schneider, 1987).

Personality and occupational choice \nThe FFM (or OCEAN) model is the most widely used model to describe personality (Costa & McCrae, 1992). This model proposes to \ndefine personality using five factors—Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neurot -\nicism—representing the main drivers of individuals’ behaviors and thoughts (Holman & Hughes, 2021). Openness to experience refers to \nbeing curious and seeking new experiences. People who are open to experience tend to be original and creative.

Research from various sources suggests that institutions \n(both in the United States and worldwide) view international collaborative degree programs as \na means to deepen ties with partners abroad, increase mobility and build global competence among faculty and students, and advance institutional internationalization more broadly.\nWhile the prospects are exciting, the study’s data illuminate the challenges entailed in estab-\nlishing joint and dual degrees, as well as some important aspects  of these programs that affect \ntheir potential outcomes and impact.

Given this imbal-\nance, collaborative degree programs may be more of a proxy for recruiting international stu-dents, and are likely to contribute to the continuing “imbalance of trade” in outward and \ninward flows of students.  The data also reveal geographic imbalances; partner institutions are \nconcentrated in Europe and Asia, with almost no representation in Africa.  These issues are worthy of note by institutions that wish to engage their U.S.-based students in international education and to establish truly collaborative, reciprocal relationships with a diversity of inter -\nnational partners.\nInbound student mobility plays an important role in campus internationalization, but it is not \nthe only important factor.

Partnerships that not only allow credit transfer back and forth, but \ntruly engage faculty, staff, and students from both institutions around substantive issues such as curriculum design and instructional philosophies have the greatest potential to advance internationalization on all these fronts.

In terms of their prevalence in the United States, ACE’s Mapping Internationalization on U.S. Campuses study found that as of 2011, 18 percent \nof responding institutions offered international dual degree programs arranged with non-U.S. partners to their home-campus students, and 13 percent offered joint degree programs. Another 16 percent were in the process of developing such programs or collaborative non-degree certif-icate programs at the time of the survey (American Council on Education 2012). \nProponents of such programs assert that they can facilitate student mobility and can con-\ntribute to curriculum internationalization efforts; other purported benefits include increased employability of graduates, revenue generation for the institution, and quality improvement through the sharing of good practices (Hénard, Diamond, and Roseveare 2012).

In a sense, he noted, the academic freedom battle “may have already been lost,” in that program participants may simply choose to avoid sensitive topics rather than venture into potentially contentious waters.\nFinally, two respondents suggested that because it was primarily administrators who completed the survey, the group as a \nwhole might not be as attuned to issues of academic freedom as their faculty counterparts would be.

INTRODUCTION\n AND  BACKGROUND \nSoftware engineering has been one of the most prom inent professions over the last 20 years, and it is \nprojected to evolve even further. Software engineering comprises stages in distinct areas, such as analysis, design, programming, testing, and maintenance. Today, specialties within software engineering are as diverse as in any other profes sion.

Those ideas invol ve: motivation (software engineers tend to perform \nbetter if they are motivated to do specific tasks), the environment, and personality type, or a \ncombination of these factors. Motivation and the environment are known to influence task performance. \nMotivation is generally a powerful element in the performance of task goals, especially in the IT field \n[4], [5]; however, motivation is often insufficien t for influencing performance of goals on its own. \nSimilarly, environmental factors cannot independently generate the performance of tasks", "source": "Personality-software"}

CONCLUSION \nAn empirical study was conducted to map some oppos ing psychological traits, such as extroversion-\nintroversion, sensing-intuition, thinking-feeling, and judging-perceiving to the main tasks of a software \nlife cycle. This work addresses the fundamental issue of the impact of human factors in software \ndevelopment. This research provides an empirical assessment of the relationships between software \nengineers’ MBTI types and role preferences. Although the MBTI does not predict success in a \nparticular career, it identifies individual preferences for specific occupations.  \nThe results indicated by the personality types INFJ, ISFP, INFP, ESFP, ENFP, ENTP, ESFJ, and \nENFJ are not relevant because of the sample size.
